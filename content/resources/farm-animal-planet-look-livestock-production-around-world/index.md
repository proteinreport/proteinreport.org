If you had to guess, would you say there are more pigs or ducks on
Earth? Do you know how many chickens there are per person? Are there
more wild animals than domesticated ones, or vice versa?

The answers to these questions certainly make for interesting bits of
trivia (and we'll get to them shortly). But they also highlight the ways
in which animal domestication is inexorably intertwined with human
development---and how our growing demand for animal products has
actually reshaped the planet.
