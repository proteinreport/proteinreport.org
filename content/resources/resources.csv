Current review provides a condensed analysis on potential environmental impacts, resource consumption rates and unintended trade-offs associated with integration of alternative proteins in complex global food system in the form of meat substitutes. We focus on emissions of greenhouse gases, land use, non-renewable energy use and water footprint highlighted for both ingredients used for meat substitutes and ready products. The benefits and limitations of meat substitution are highlighted in relation to a weight and protein content. The analysis of the recent research literature allowed us to define issues, that require the attention of future studies.</p>",11348,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922006632,"Academic Research"

The industrialization of cultured meat for wide-spread adoption requires new methods to efficiently collect high-quality cells and to preserve their cell quality. Cryopreservation is a widely used technique to enable the long-term storage of cells without causing severe damage. In this study, we focused on the feasibility of cryopreservation to maintain cell quality for storage of bovine myogenic cells harvested from bovine meat based on our unique primary culture method. Primary bovine cells were incubated in a culture dish and then cryopreserved at −80°C for 1 week or 1 year. After thawing, the cells were further cultured for several passages to evaluate the abilities of the cells to proliferate or differentiate into myotubes. Furthermore, the cells were repeatedly cryopreserved for 1 week each time to investigate the impact of the repeated freezing and thawing. Consequently, long-term (within 1 year) or repeated (up to 3 times for 1 week each) cryopreservation at −80°C caused no degradation in the abilities of the cells to proliferate or differentiate, which is important for cultured meat production. We also confirmed that the cryopreservation did not require any unique cell freezing media. Moreover, based on our tissue engineering technique, our cryopreserved bovine myogenic cells had the ability to form sarcomere structures and produce muscle contractions even after they were frozen for 1 year. Although the bovine muscle tissues described here require more mature structures and functions in order to closely mimic native muscle tissue, we believe that the functional maturation of myogenic cells is essential to produce a “tissue-engineered meat” that will have native-like nutrients, texture, and taste that consumers will expect in the future. These results reveal the potential of cryopreserving quality-controlled bovine myogenic cells to contribute to a stable supply of high-quality cells for cultured meat&nbsp;production.</p>",11295,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1023057/full,"Academic Research"

Cultivated meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces meat products by proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in large bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell culture and media availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of cultured beef per year or ~0.14% of the annual global beef production. Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®, facilities are modeled to create a comprehensive analysis to highlight improvements that can lower the cost of such a production system and allow cultivated meat products to be competitive. Three facility scenarios are presented with different sized production reactors; ~42,000 L stirred tank bioreactor (STR) with a base case cost of goods sold (COGS) of $35/kg, ~211,000 L STR with a COGS of $25/kg, and ~262,000 L airlift reactor (ALR) with a COGS of $17/kg.

The most challenging aspect of the production process is the rapid proliferation of cells and establishment of the desired 3D structure for mass production. In this study, we developed a direct ink writing-based 3D-bioprinted meat culture platform composed of 6% (w/v) alginate and 4% (w/v) gelatin (Alg/Gel)-based hydrogel scaffolds supplemented with naturally derived protein hydrolysates (PHs; 10%) from highly nutritive plants (soybean, pigeon pea, and wheat), and some selected edible insects (beetles, crickets, and mealworms) on in vitro proliferation of bovine myosatellite cells (bMSCs) extracted from fresh meat samples. The developed bioink exhibited excellent shear-thinning behavior (<em>n</em> &lt; 1) and mechanical stability during 3D bioprinting. Commercial proteases (Alcalase, Neutrase, and Flavourzyme) were used for protein hydrolysis. The resulting hydrolysates exhibited lower-molecular-weight bands (12–50 kDa) than those of crude isolates (55–160 kDa), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The degree of hydrolysis was higher in the presence of Alcalase for both plant (34%) and insect (62%) PHs than other enzymes. The 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds displayed excellent bioactivity and stability after 7 days of incubation. The developed prototype structure (pepperoni meat, 20 × 20 × 5 mm) provided a highly stable, nutritious, and mechanically strong structure that supported the rapid proliferation of myoblasts in a low-serum environment during the entire culture period. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay enhanced the free radical reduction of Alcalase- and Neutrase-treated PHs. Furthermore, the bioprinted bMSCs displayed early myogenesis (desmin and Pax7) in the presence of PHs, suggesting its role in bMSC differentiation. In conclusion, we developed a 3D bioprinted and bioactive meat culture platform using Alg/Gel/PHs as a printable and edible component for the mass production of cultured meat.</p>",11120,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.2c10620,"Academic Research"

However, cell culture on inedible microcarriers involves extra downstream processing to dissociate cells prior to consumption. Here, we present edible microcarriers that can support the expansion and differentiation of myogenic cells in a single bioreactor system. To fabricate edible microcarriers with a scalable process, we used water-in-oil emulsions as templates for gelatin microparticles. We also developed a novel embossing technique to imprint edible microcarriers with grooved topology in order to test if microcarriers with striated surface texture can promote myoblast proliferation and differentiation in suspension culture. In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed that edible microcarriers with both smooth and grooved surface topologies supported the proliferation and differentiation of mouse myogenic <span class=""caps"">C2C12</span> cells in a suspension culture. The grooved edible microcarriers showed a modest increase in the proliferation and alignment of myogenic cells compared to cells cultured on smooth, spherical microcarriers. During the expansion phase, we also observed the formation of cell-microcarrier aggregates or ‘microtissues’ for cells cultured on both smooth and grooved microcarriers. Myogenic microtissues cultured with smooth and grooved microcarriers showed similar characteristics in terms of myotube length, myotube volume fraction, and expression of myogenic markers. To establish feasibility of edible microcarriers for cultured meat, we showed that edible microcarriers supported the production of myogenic microtissue from <span class=""caps"">C2C12</span> or bovine satellite muscle cells, which we harvested by centrifugation into a cookable meat patty that maintained its shape and exhibited browning during cooking.

As part of this trend, most scholars have called for policymakers to combine multiple agencies, rather than rely on a single agency, to solve policy problems. The literature in this area espouses the benefits of shared regulatory space. But very little of this scholarship addresses when shared jurisdiction is problematic. This is particularly concerning when an agency opts into or cedes oversight authority to another agency at will, with little regard for whether the second agency is an appropriate regulator. The case of cell-cultured (or lab-grown) meat presents one such example. In 2018, both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture separately announced that regulating cell-cultured meat fell under their sole purview, to the exclusion of the other agency. After much back-and-forth, the agencies issued a joint statement announcing a shared system of regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>This Article argues that the FDA should not have ceded any of its regulatory authority to the USDA because joint regulation of cell-cultured meat, as between the FDA and USDA, is both inappropriate and unnecessary. USDA involvement is inappropriate because the Department suffers from a mixed mandate problem. Not only is the Department tasked with maximizing agricultural industry profits (and minimizing losses), but it is also tasked with nourishing Americans (and improving nutrition and health). In the case of cell-cultured meat, these two goals are diametrically opposed. Further, USDA involvement is inappropriate given the Department’s purview, as set by Congress, and its concomitant expertise. As it relates to meat, the USDA exists specifically to monitor the safety and sanitation of the nation’s farms, slaughterhouses, and meat processing and packaging plants. Consequently, all the Department’s meat-related regulations and expertise are in these areas. USDA involvement in the regulation of cell-cultured meat is also unnecessary because it is redundant. Accordingly, this Article’s analysis belies the notion that all agency collaboration is good collaboration.</p>",11098,,https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/wlulr/vol78/iss5/4/,"Academic Research"

Cultivated meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces meat products by proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in large bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell fermentation and media availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of cultured beef per year or ~0.14% of the annual global beef production. Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®, facilities are modelled to create a comprehensive techno-economic analysis (<span class=""caps"">TEA</span>) to highlight improvements that can lower the cost of such a production system and allow cultivated meat products to be competitive.

Mold-based protein enriched scaffolds exhibited elevated stability and stiffness compared to ones made of Alginate (<span class=""caps"">RGD</span>) alone, while allowing unhindered <span class=""caps"">BSC</span> spreading and maturation. Extrusion based 3D-printing with the two compositions was then developed, while using an edible, removable agar support bath. Successfully fabricated constructs with well-defined geometries supported <span class=""caps"">BSC</span> attachment and differentiation. Finally, cellular bioprinting was demonstrated with <span class=""caps"">PPI</span>-enriched bioinks. Cell recovery post-printing was observed in two cultivation configurations, reaching ∼80–90% viability over time. Moreover, cells could mature within 3D-printed cellular constructs. As animal-derived materials were avoided in our scaffold fabrication process, and pea-protein is known for its low allergic risk, these findings have great promise for further cultivated meat&nbsp;research.</p>",10656,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961222001260,"Academic Research"

Using a choice experiment involving chicken meat products that vary across four attributes (i.e., production method, carbon trust label, antibiotics use and price), our results show that consumers prefer chicken meat produced through the conventional production method and tend to generally reject IVM. However, the term ‘cultured’ is less disliked than the terms ‘lab-grown’ and ‘artificial’, and ‘artificial’ is less disliked than ‘lab-grown’. Results also indicate that consumers’ valuations are heterogeneous over differing consumer attitudes.

The main <span class=""caps"">TE</span> principles include usage of cells, grown in a controlled environment provided by bioreactors and cultivation media supplemented with growth factors and other needed nutrients and signaling molecules, and seeded onto the immobilization elements—microcarriers and scaffolds that provide the adhesion surfaces necessary for anchor-dependent cells and offer 3D organization for multiple cell types. Theoretically, many solutions from regenerative medicine and biomedical engineering can be applied in <span class=""caps"">CM</span>-<span class=""caps"">TE</span>, i.e., <span class=""caps"">CA</span>. However, in practice, there are a number of specificities regarding fabrication of a <span class=""caps"">CM</span> product that needs to fulfill not only the majority of functional criteria of muscle and fat <span class=""caps"">TE</span>, but also has to possess the sensory and nutritional qualities of a traditional food component, i.e., the meat it aims to replace.

Cultured meat is presented as a good alternative for consumers who want to be more sustainable but do not wish to change their diet. To validate this sustainability claim, this report evaluates four <span class=""caps"">LCA</span> studies on cultured meat. When comparing overall environmental impact of cultured meat with conventional meat products and other meat substitutes, cultured meat was seen to perform significantly better than beef, favourable to pork, similar to chicken, and worse than plant-based alternatives considering current global average production impacts. It is important to realize that currently no commercial-scale cultured meat facility is operational. All <span class=""caps"">LCA</span> studies modelled a future facility, extrapolating scientific and small-scale facilities. Differences in system boundaries lead to high variability of environmental impact results for cultured meat among reviewed studies. The <span class=""caps"">LCA</span> system boundaries mostly include the cultivation-related processes, while product formulation and distribution are not taken into account. An important technical bottleneck that is not addressed are the large volumes of the fermenters and the extended cultivation times, which will need extraordinary sterility measures. The <span class=""caps"">LCA</span> overview shows that cultured meat production is energy intensive and that energy consumption have the highest contribution in the overall impact. Next, growth medium production showed significant contribution to impact, especially the amino acid production and recombinant protein production for growth factors. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters showed that parameter choices on cell density and medium use impacted the results most. Technically, the cultured meat industry is still very much in development. Obvious improvements that are needed are the reduction in energy, development of scaffolds, and lower medium cost, specifically in developing cheaper plant-based growth factors that are non <span class=""caps"">GMO</span>. Also product development is in its infancy. Cultured meat is part of a movement towards more sustainable meat alternatives that also includes plant-based alternatives, insects and microbial protein. These sources should not be regarded as competition but as complementary products that target different types of consumers. In combination with other meat alternatives, cultured meat can lead to reduced production and consumption of conventional&nbsp;meat.</p>",10506,,https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/review-and-analysis-of-studies-on-sustainability-of-cultured-meat,"Academic Research"

We show that, even in the absence of any other emission reductions, persistent drops in atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide levels, and slower carbon dioxide accumulation, following a phaseout of livestock production would, through the end of the century, have the same cumulative effect on the warming potential of the atmosphere as a 25 gigaton per year reduction in anthropogenic <span class=""caps"">CO2</span> emissions, providing half of the net emission reductions necessary to limit warming to 2°C.

Low growth rate, metabolic inefficiency, catabolite inhibition, and shear-induced cell damage will all limit practical bioreactor volume and attainable cell density. Equipment and facilities with adequate microbial contamination safeguards have high capital costs. The projected costs of suitably pure amino acids and protein growth factors are also high. The replacement of amino-acid media with plant protein hydrolysates is discussed and requires further study. Capital- and operating-cost analyses of conceptual cell-mass production facilities indicate economics that would likely preclude the affordability of their products as food.

There is a need for an edible scaffold suitable for the growth of animal muscle. This study showed that decellularizing spinach leaves produced an edible scaffold that has a vascular network that could potentially maintain the viability of primary bovine satellite cells as they develop into meat. Primary bovine satellite cells were cultured on the surface of decellularized spinach leaves and gelatin coated glass for 7 and 14 days. After 14 days, primary bovine satellite cells seeded on the decellularized leaf scaffold maintained ~99% viability; and ~25% of the cells showed expression of myosin heavy-chain. Cell alignment varied between animals from which the cells were acquired. Areas of alignment were observed showing an average kappa value for cytoskeletal alignment of 0.71 ± 0.1 after 14 days in culture. There was no statistical significance in each category between cells cultured on gelatin coated glass and decellularized spinach leaves. These results suggested that decellularized spinach is a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly scaffold, that can potentially accelerate the development of laboratory-grown meat by providing an edible substrate for bovine satellite&nbsp;cells.</p>",8684,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212429221001115,"Academic Research"

However, significant potential exists for expanding these techniques to diverse applications by looking across the taxonomic tree to bioactive metabolites not synthesized in animals. Namely, cross-taxa metabolic engineering of mammalian cells could offer value in applications ranging fromfood and nutrition to regenerative medicine and gene therapy. Towards the former, recent advances in meat production through cell culture suggest the potential to produce meat with fine cellular control, where tuning composition through cross-taxa metabolic engineering could enhance nutrition and food-functionality. Here we demonstrate this possibility by engineering primary bovine and immortalized murine muscle cells with prokaryotic enzymes to endogenously produce the antioxidant carotenoids phytoene, lycopene and β-carotene. These phytonutrients offer general nutritive value and protective effects against diseases associated with red and processed meat consumption, and so offer a promising proof-of-concept for nutritional engineering in cultured meat. We demonstrate the phenotypic integrity of engineered cells, the ability to tune carotenoid yields, and the antioxidant functionality of these compounds in vitro towards both nutrition and food-quality objectives.

Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050.

Although some evidence points to an ongoing reduction in meat consumption in Europe, consumers are overall unwilling to cut their meat consumption in a substantial way. The present study investigates dietary identities and perceptions of cultured meat in nationally representative samples from Germany (n = 1000) and France (n = 1000). Participants were recruited through an Ipsos panel to answer an online survey, which included questions about their current and intended consumption of conventional meat, as well as questions about their opinions of cultured meat. We find that, whilst rates of vegetarianism were relatively low in France, unrestricted meat-eaters were a minority in Germany, and concern for animal welfare was the most common reason given for meat reduction. Substantial markets for cultured meat exist in both countries, although German consumers are significantly more open to the concept than the French. Strikingly, cultured meat acceptance is significantly higher amongst agricultural and meat workers, indicating that those who are closest to existing meat production methods are most likely to prefer alternatives. We found some evidence that pro-cultured meat messages, which focus on antibiotic resistance and food safety, are significantly more persuasive than those that focus on animals or the environment. Furthermore, consumers project that they would be significantly more likely to consume cultured meat that does not contain genetically modified ingredients. Overall, we find substantially large markets for cultured meat in Germany and France, and identify some potential ways to further increase acceptance in these markets. We conclude by highlighting the most promising markets for cultured meat, and highlighting a lack of antibiotics as a potentially persuasive message about cultured&nbsp;meat.</p>",7974,,https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/9/9/1152,"Academic Research"

<p>COVID-19 is at least the sixth global health pandemic since the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918, and although it has its origins in microbes carried by animals, like all pandemics its emergence has been entirely driven by human activities, says the report released on Thursday. It is estimated that another 1.7 million currently ‘undiscovered’ viruses exist in mammals and birds – of which up to 850,000 could have the ability to infect people.</p>
<p>“There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic – or of any modern pandemic”, said Dr. Peter Daszak, President of <a href=""https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-peter-daszak"">EcoHealth Alliance</a> and Chair of the IPBES workshop. “The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment.

We find support for many of the findings of our previous review, as well as novel insights into the market for cultured meat. We find evidence of a substantial market for cultured meat in many countries, as well as markets and demographics which are particularly open to the concept. Consumers mostly identified animal- and environment-related benefits, but there is plenty of potential to highlight personal benefits such as health and food safety. The safety of cultured meat and its nutritional qualities are intuitively seen as risks by some consumers, although some recognize potential benefits in these areas. Evidence suggests that acceptance can be increased with positive information, as well as frames which invoke more positive associations. We conclude by arguing that cultured meat will form one part of a varied landscape of future protein sources, each appealing to different groups of consumers to achieve an overall reduction in conventional meat consumption. We acknowledge a range of pro-cultured meat messaging strategies, and suggest that framing cultured meat as a solution to existing food safety problems may be an effective approach to increase acceptance. In the long-term, objections based in neophobia and norm violation will decrease, and widespread acceptance will depend in large part on the price and&nbsp;taste.</p>",7570,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/15/5201,"Academic Research"

The technology and methods to be used for commercial production are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications such as antibiotics.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome, and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members' roles. Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate, the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Why GAO Did This Study</h2>
<p>Multiple firms have produced cell-cultured meat as part of their research and development. These products appear likely to become available to consumers in coming years. FDA and USDA are the primary agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's food supply. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the agencies' oversight of cell-cultured meat amidst a fragmented federal food safety oversight system.</p>
<p>GAO was asked to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to selected cell-cultured meat firms.</p>
<h2>What GAO Recommends</h2>
<p>GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies' interagency agreement. FDA and USDA partially concurred and indicated a willingness to incorporate these practices in a more detailed agreement, which would also meet the intent of the recommendations. The agencies concurred with the four other recommendations.</p>",6841,"report image",https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-325,"Industry Report"

The technology necessary to culture cells for human consumption is developing at a rapid pace. The concept is relativity simple in that it uses cells of animal origin and raises them in a bioreactor to produce food that closely mimics meat products traditionally derived from harvesting animals. While the concept of producing cell cultivated meat is simple, the implementation has proven to be very challenging. Today, cell cultivated meat is not available for consumer purchase at retail or food service outlets. Still, current efforts are underway to scale up production of cell cultivated meat, but the industry faces several technology hurdles. Those hurdles include lowering the cost of media used to cultivate cells, developing cell lines that can be propagated indefinitely and producing finished products that possess the same palatable and nutritional characteristics of traditionally produced meat products. At the same time that technological challenges are being navigated, other issues such as governmental regulatory oversight, product labeling, and even nomenclature policy must be addressed. Steps are currently underway to develop a regulatory framework for cell cultivated meat and legislation is being considered to provide federal definitions to ensure clear communication to consumers. In fact, food products produced from cell culture technology are referred to by many names such as: “cultivated meat”, “clean meat”, “cultured meat”, “lab meat”, “fake meat”, “cell cultivated meat”, and “in vitro meat”. Finally, because cell cultivated meat is a brand-new platform in food production, food safety cannot be overlooked. As with any novel food, understanding and mitigating potential safety risks is critical. Because the production systems associated with producing cell cultivated meat are so different from obtaining meat directly from animal sources, there may be food consumption hazards that are not present in conventionally produced meat products. Cell cultivated meat may become available in retail outlets within the next 5 years. Before that happens, all these issues and many others must be addressed.</p>",6834,"Report cover",https://www.cast-science.org/publication/producing-food-products-from-cultured-animal-tissues/,"Industry Report"

Biodiversity is being degraded and lost to a considerable extent, with 70 % of the world’s deforestation a result of stripping in order to grow animal feed. Furthermore, about 14.5 % of the world’s anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are calculated to be the result of (mainly industrial) livestock farming. The research reviewed here focuses on the feasibility of reducing meat consumption in developed and transition countries, as this would—among other positive effects—reduce the global loss of biodiversity, the need for unsustainable agricultural practices and GHG emissions. This article reviews the barriers, opportunities and steps that need to be taken in order to encourage the consumption of less meat, based on an interdisciplinary and multifactor approach. The evidence is gathered from a systematic meta-analysis of factors (including personal, sociocultural and external factors) that influence individual meat-eating behaviour. The most relevant factors that influence behaviour appear to be emotions and cognitive dissonance (between knowledge, conflicting values and actual behaviour) and sociocultural factors (e.g. social norms or social identity). For different factors and groups of people, different strategies are appropriate. For example, for men and older people deploying the health argument or arguing for flexitarianism (reduced meat consumption) may prove the most promising approaches, while providing emotional messages or promoting new social norms is recommended in order to address barriers such as cognitive dissonance.</p>",521,,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/reducing-meat-consumption-developed-transition-countries-counter-climate-change-biodiversity-loss-re-1/,"Academic Research"

Design/methodology/approach – The prevalence of different barriers for following a plant-based diet is addressed, as well as consumer profiles considering socio-demographics, values and meat consumption frequencies. The data were collected in 2010 by a survey questionnaire, sent to 4,000 randomly selected Finns (response rate=47.3, n=1,890). Findings – Different types of barriers are perceived to hinder the adoption of a plant-based diet, including meat enjoyment, eating routines, health conceptions and difficulties in preparing vegetarian foods. These barriers are strongly correlated, indicating that consumers may not make qualitative difference between different barriers. Furthermore, there are distinct socio-demographic, value and especially meat consumption frequency elements that strengthen the barrier perception, these being male gender, young age, rural residence, household type of families with children, low education, absence of a vegetarian family member or friend, valuation of traditions and wealth and high meat consumption frequency. Social implications – High meat consumption is related to many environmental and public health problems. The results call for multifaceted policy implications that should concentrate on different barriers and certain socio-demographic, value and meat eating groups. Importantly, focus should be not only on the group with the strongest barrier perception but also on those particularly willing to make changes in their meat consumption patterns. One practical implication could be to increase the availability of vegetarian foods in public cafeterias or school canteens, as a decrease in meat consumption frequency is strongly correlated with the alleviation of the barrier perception.

Two survey studies conducted in heterogeneous community samples (Study 1, <em>N</em> = 260; Study 2, <em>N</em> = 489) demonstrated that right-wing ideologies predict greater acceptance of animal exploitation and more meat consumption through two explaining mechanisms: (a) perceived threat from non-exploitive ideologies to the dominant carnist ideology (for both SDO and RWA) and (b) belief in human superiority over animals (for SDO). These findings hold after controlling for hedonistic pleasure from eating meat.

We assumed that, due to a domain general action-oriented state, people tend to resolve the meat paradox via moral disengagement, even if inconsistency is elicited in a different, not food-related domain. Two experiments were conducted, in which we assessed people’s moral disengagement efforts via ambivalence measures after we induced inconsistency using different threats in meat-unrelated domains. Supporting our assumptions, people showed reduced ambivalence towards food in affective priming (Experiment 1) and Mouse-Tracker tasks (Experiment 2) after experiencing inconsistency. In fact, plant-based dishes became more positive and meat dishes more negative after inconsistency was induced, indicating that people disguise their endorsement of meat.

The aim of this paper is to identify predictors of meat consumption and the intention to reduce it. Since meat consumption is one of the major contributors to human made environmental destruction including climate change, biodiversity loss or water and air pollution and at the same time under volitional control meat consumption is an interesting target for&nbsp;interventions.","<p>Purpose<br />
The aim of this paper is to identify predictors of meat consumption and the intention to reduce it. Since meat consumption is one of the major contributors to human made environmental destruction including climate change, biodiversity loss or water and air pollution and at the same time under volitional control meat consumption is an interesting target for&nbsp;interventions.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach<br />
An integrated model was derived from the theory of planned behaviour, the norm activation theory and the protection motivation theory which was tested in a paper-pencil based questionnaire study including self-reported meat consumption was conducted with a convenience sample of 210 adult inhabitants of Trondheim&nbsp;(Norway).</p>
<p>Findings<br />
The model was confirmed to a large extent. Meat consumption was predicted strongly by meat eating habits, but also negatively by reduction intentions. Reduction intentions were determined by attitudes, moral beliefs and health beliefs. Moral beliefs were predicted by injunctive and descriptive norms as well as perceived behavioural&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications<br />
The study was based on a convenience sample, thus the sample is not representative. Furthermore, some of the measurement instruments are of only mediocre&nbsp;quality.</p>
<p>Practical implications<br />
The results show that interventions to reduce meat consumption need to include habits braking components to be effective. Meat consumption reduction is motivated by a broad array of motivations, including morality and health. Intervention campaigns need to cover this&nbsp;spectrum.</p>
<p>Originality/value<br />
This study is one of the first that systematically analyses determinants of meat consumption which makes it valuable in spite of its&nbsp;limitations.</p>",108,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/BFJ-08-2012-0193/full/html,"Academic Research"

Missing from these debates are the public perspectives about eating less meat and consideration of cultural and social values associated with meat. The aim of this study was to explore public awareness of the environmental impact of food and their willingness to reduce meat consumption. Twelve focus groups and four individual interviews were conducted with adults from a range of socio-economic groups living in both rural and urban settings in Scotland. Public understanding of the link between food, environment and climate change was explored, with a focus on meat and attitudes towards reducing meat consumption. Data were transcribed and analysed thematically. Three dominant themes emerged: a lack of awareness of the association between meat consumption and climate change, perceptions of personal meat consumption playing a minimal role in the global context of climate change, and resistance to the idea of reducing personal meat consumption. People associated eating meat with pleasure, and described social, personal and cultural values around eating meat. Some people felt they did not need to eat less meat because they had already reduced their consumption or that they only ate small quantities. Scepticism of scientific evidence linking meat and climate change was common. Changing non-food related behaviours was viewed as more acceptable and a greater priority for climate change mitigation. The study highlights the role meat plays in the diet for many people, beyond nutritional needs. If healthy, sustainable dietary habits are to be achieved, cultural, social and personal values around eating meat must be integrated into the development of future dietary&nbsp;recommendations.</p>",103,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Eating-like-there&#039;s-no-tomorrow%3A-Public-awareness-a-Macdiarmid-Douglas/568a9200d50b4ba225486849b601824c94be92ba,"Academic Research"

Using cross-sectional data (n = 368) and binary logistic regression modeling, the study identifies gender, age, familiarity, food neophobia, convenience and environmental food choice motives, as well as meat-related attitudes and future meat consumption intentions as significant predictors. The predicted likelihood of adopting insects as a substitute for meat is 12.8% [95% <span class=""caps"">CI</span>: 6.1–19.4%] for males and 6.3% [95% <span class=""caps"">CI</span>: 2.8–9.9%] for females, other predictor variables held constant at their mean value. People who claim to be familiar with the idea of eating insects have a 2.6 times higher likelihood, and consumers who intend to reduce fresh meat intake are up to 4.5 times more likely to adopt insects. Food neophobia makes the largest contribution to consumers’ readiness to adopt insects: a one-unit increase in the food neophobia score is associated with a 84% decrease in the predicted odds of being ready to adopt insects. A stronger convenience orientation in food choice and a higher interest in the environmental impact of food choice increase the likelihood of adopting insects by 75% and 71% per unit increase in these predictors’ scores, respectively. By contrast, a one-unit stronger belief that meat is nutritious and healthy, and a one-unit higher importance attached to taste for meat lower the predicted odds by 64% and 61%, respectively. This study reveals that the most likely early adopters of insects as a novel and more sustainable protein source in Western societies are younger males with a weak attachment to meat, who are more open to trying novel foods and interested in the environmental impact of their food&nbsp;choice.</p>",100,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329314001554,"Academic Research"

Each factor showed distinctive effects on the probability of eating meat and the amount consumed. The amount of meat eaten was greater when eating with family members compared to when alone or with other companions. Both the probability and amount of meat eaten in a single eating occasion were higher on Sundays compared to the rest of the week. Eating out (e.g. restaurants/cafes) increased the probability of consuming meat and the amount compared to other situations (e.g. home, work). When considering the factors influencing meat consumption, attention must be paid to the effects of social, temporal, and situational factors as they all work to shape consumption behaviour.

However, large segments of consumers do not seem willing to make such transition. While it may take a profound societal change to achieve significant progresses on this regard, there have been limited attempts to understand the psychosocial processes that may hinder or facilitate this shift. This study provides an in-depth exploration of how consumer representations of meat, the impact of meat, and rationales for changing or not habits relate with willingness to adopt a more plant-based diet. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was employed to examine participant responses (N = 410) to a set of open-ended questions, free word association tasks and closed questions. Three clusters with two hallmarks each were identified: (1) a pattern of disgust towards meat coupled with moral internalization; (2) a pattern of low affective connection towards meat and willingness to change habits; and (3) a pattern of attachment to meat and unwillingness to change habits. The findings raise two main propositions. The first is that an affective connection towards meat relates to the perception of the impacts of meat and to willingness to change consumption habits. The second proposition is that a set of rationales resembling moral disengagement mechanisms (e.g., pro-meat justifications; self-exonerations) arise when some consumers contemplate the consequences of meat production and consumption, and the possibility of changing&nbsp;habits.</p>",98,,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/meat-beyond-plate-datadriven-hypotheses-understanding-consumer-willingness-adopt-more-plantbased-die/,"Academic Research"

To identify measures that may change consumption patterns towards more plant-based foods, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the causes behind the demand for meat. In this paper we use data from 137 different countries to identify and assess factors that influence meat consumption at the national level using a cross-country <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/multivariate-regression"">multivariate regression</a> analysis. We specify either total meat or ruminant meat as the dependent variable and we consider a broad range of potential drivers of meat consumption. The combination of explanatory variables we use is new for this type of analysis. In addition, we estimate the relative importance of the different drivers. We find that income per capita followed by rate of urbanisation are the two most important drivers of total meat consumption per capita. Income per capita and natural endowment factors are major drivers of ruminant meat consumption per capita. Other drivers are Western culture, Muslim religion, female labour participation, economic and social globalisation and meat prices. The main identified drivers of meat demand are difficult to influence through direct policy intervention. Thus, acting indirectly on consumers’ preferences and consumption habits (for instance through information, education policy and increased availability of ready-made plant based products) could be of key importance for mitigating the rise of meat consumption per capita all over the world.</p>

<p>Yes. Population growth, urbanization and the rising middle class have increased the global demand for food, especially animal based protein sources.</p>

<p>One of the many ways to address food and feed security is through insect farming. Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly, and they have high growth and feed conversion rates and a low environmental footprint over their entire life cycle. They are nutritious, with high protein, fat and mineral contents. They can be reared on waste streams like food waste. Moreover, they can be eaten whole or ground into a powder or paste, and incorporated into other foods. The use of insects on a large scale as a feed ingredient is technically feasible, and established companies in various parts of the world are already leading the way in this regard. Insects as feedstock for aquaculture and poultry feed are likely to become more prevalent within the next decade.</p>",26,"edible insects",http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3264e/i3264e00.pdf,"Industry Report"
