<p><strong>We are Planted.</strong> After years of research, founded in July 2019 as a spin-off from ETH Zurich, it is our very aim to make the world better. With a revolutionary plan: Meat from plants.</p>
<p>Planted is more than a delicious product – it’s also an attitude. We want to radically change the way people consume and perceive meat. And to trigger a switch from eating animal- to plant-based proteins.</p>
<p>We are making a change. Not only because we can but because we have to. Be part of our journey and join our Science Team as an Industrial Biotechnologist.</p>
<p>As Industrial Biotechnologist, you will change the game with us. You will work at the interface between research and industrial implementation of fermented plant-based foods, making sustainable foods even more sustainable, healthy and tasty. </p>
<p><strong>Your mission:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>build and expand high performance fermentation platforms to upscale biotech innovations</li>
<li>implement and create new biotechnological processes internally and in collaboration with industrial partners</li>
<li>manage and organize multiple science and implementation projects in the interdisciplinary fields of biotechnology, material science, and food process engineering</li>
<li>align fermentation strategies to business and consumer needs and vice versa</li>
<li>actively contribute to and work on industrial projects in the field of biotechnology and plant-based raw materials</li>
<li>closely work together with our internal science and product development teams to upscale plant-based food products</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>You:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>are a self-driven person with a higher education specialized in (Bio)Chemical Engineering, Process Engineering, Food Biotechnology, Biotechnology or a similar background. A PhD in Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering or Microbiology is a plus.</li>
