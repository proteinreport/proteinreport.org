<h2>About Eden Bio</h2>
<p>Eden Bio is a cutting-edge biotech startup at the heart of the synthetic biology revolution happening right now in White City, west London. Proteins are essential across industries, from foods and nutraceuticals to industrial enzymes and therapeutics. Challenges producing these products can make them commercially inaccessible and Eden Bio breaks down this barrier. With our unique machine-learning platform to guide genetic engineering, we increase the protein production capabilities of microorganisms, enabling a range of new products and assisting the transition to animal-free protein products.</p>
<p>With approaching Net Zero targets and worsening global warming, the world needs to move away from animal products to reach a sustainable future. Eden Bio’s services revolutionise the microorganism fermentation process in support of this goal, using synthetic biology to ferment molecularly-identical animal products vats, just like how beer is brewed.</p>
