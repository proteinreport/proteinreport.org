<p><strong>About Roslin Technologies</strong> </p>
<p>Roslin Technologies is an ambitious, cutting‐edge biotech company focused on food and agriculture. Our mission is to advance disruptive biotechnologies to improve how we produce proteins.

<p>We focus on providing superior biological materials to alternative protein supply chains. Today, our core competency (&gt;80% of our business) is to provide self-replicating cell lines to cultivated meat producers globally.

Roslin Tech has the most advanced cell lines, is the only independent provider globally and we ship cells to customers in the UK, EU, North America, and Asia. We are rapidly growing and work very closely with our customers. In addition to our cell line platform, we are developing and commercialising a breeding programme for black soldier fly to support the emerging insect protein sector which is the prime example of circular and sustainable agriculture. At Roslin Tech we benefit from a privileged relationship with Roslin Institute, the creator of Dolly the Sheep, and many other scientific breakthroughs in animal protein. </p>
