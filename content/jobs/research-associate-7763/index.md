description: "Do you have a passion for using biotechnology to build sustainable new sources of animal-free protein?  Then we are looking for you.   Do you want to join a new community of entrepreneurs, activists and scientists who recognize that the decades old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7 billion people – and that biotechnology may hold a solution. You will love our mission of using innovative robotics and synthetic DNA technology to create novel sources of protein for human nutrition."
