<p>Ever heard of a concept called “<strong>cultured meat</strong>?”<strong> </strong>Kinda a big deal these days…  We hope to succeed in bringing to people healthy and <strong>cruelty-free meat</strong> as soon as possible. If you can help us do it, check us out and apply.</p>
<p><strong>About us in a nutshell</strong>🥩<br />
We are <strong>the first European cell-based </strong><a href="https://www.mewery.io/">food tech startup</a><strong> </strong>developing cultivated <strong>pork</strong> on a <strong>microalgae</strong> base. Our unique microalgae technology aims to break down barriers to scaling and accelerating the cultivated meat industry. We are developing a porcine cell line for a proprietary hybrid media which doesn’t require FBS. It rather uses the microalgae growth factors to significantly reduce the production costs of cultivated meat.</p>
<p><strong>Mewery is out there </strong>🗞️<br />
We have a <a href="https://www.mewery.io/index.html#team">strong team</a> of scientists with knowledge of mammalian as well as microalgae cells and its cultivation. Now we could really use a Cell culture specialist / Tissue engineer / Cell biologist, one of those. 🤓</p>
<p><strong>What we need from you</strong>🔬<br />
You would be part of a team that is <strong>developing </strong>and<strong> optimising technological processes</strong> in the cultured meat biotech industry. The main focus is to establish highly effective and easy-to-reproduce procedures <strong>from isolation to large scale-ups of mammalian cells. </strong>Cell culture specialist will work in close interaction with team members to be able to finalise experiments under team collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Desired experiences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>excellent at mammalian cells / primary cells / stem cells culturing</li>
<li>experienced with primary cells isolation (an advantage)</li>
<li>experienced in molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, or similar</li>
<li>university degree in life sciences, medicine, veterinary medicine, or similar</li>
<li>willingness to learn</li>
<li>independent in the laboratory environment</li>
<li>fluent in English</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responsibilities: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>establishing mammalian primary cell lines from isolation to differentiation</li>
<li>present the data in front of the research team and collaborators, with recommendations, ideas, and advice</li>
<li>working with different biological sources of primary cells</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you get from us</strong>🥂<br />
Joining a startup no longer means lousy conditions for employees. Apart from basic standards such as <strong>5 weeks' holidays </strong>and <strong>f</strong><strong>lexible working hours</strong>, at Mewery, you will have a chance to actually <strong>be part of a really important shift in human history</strong>, at least the history of food. </p>
