<p>Roslin Technologies is an ambitious, cutting‐edge biotech company focused on food and agriculture. Our mission is to advance disruptive biotechnologies to improve how we produce proteins. Alternative proteins are key for a more sustainable food system. We envision a world where we can produce animal proteins without harming our health, the planet, or animals and ensure everyone has access to affordable, nutritious proteins.</p>
<p>Our main focus is on developing animal cell technologies for the emerging cultivated meat sector. We develop stem cell lines using ground-breaking technologies, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We provide these cell lines to cultivated meat producers globally who will use these cell lines to develop and produce cultivated meat. Our approach is unique to this sector both in terms of technology and business model. Our animal cell lines are playing a key role in bringing the reality of cultivated meat closer.</p>
<p>Our brilliant team of experts are passionate, curious, inventive and at the forefront of the ground-breaking work being accomplished in this rapidly growing, cultivated meat sector.</p>
<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>The role is an exciting career opportunity for a post-Doctoral scientist with extensive experience in cell culture media development.</p>
<p>Our Team has derived high quality animal stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells. The next step is to show that these cells are uniquely qualified to scale up to high densities in large bioreactors in safe, cost-effective media. The role will involve you working across our innovation and commercially facing teams developing and implementing solutions fit-for-purpose media for our various cell lines. </p>
<p><strong>Essential skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Undergraduate degree (BSc/MSc) and PhD in an appropriate discipline (Cell Biology, Bioprocessing, or Bioengineering)</li>
<li>Experience in working with adherent and/or suspension stem cell culture and/or experience in cell culture media design/development </li>
<li>Excellent data analysis skills, ideally with experience in Design of Experiments approaches</li>
<li>Proven ability to develop and test protocols </li>
<li>Proven ability to deliver a research project, including the design and execution of experiments</li>
