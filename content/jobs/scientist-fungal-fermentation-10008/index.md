<p>The Better Meat Co. (BMC) is a sustainable food tech startup based in Sacramento, California. Well-funded and partnered with major food companies like Hormel Foods, we’ve built and are operating North America’s largest mycelium biomass fermentation facility, advancing our patented technology to create the most sustainable food future for our planet. </p>
<p>Under the direction of the Senior Director of Research, the Fungal Fermentation Scientist will be responsible for improving fermentation processes at the bench scale, and in coordination with the plant scale. As a Fermentation Scientist, you will play a lead role in tackling key challenges in producing a novel food product. You will be a subject matter expert in fungal physiology, growth, and metabolism, and drive the development and optimization of traditional and non-traditional fermentation technology and production workflows. </p>
<p><strong>Key responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promote scientific and data-driven approaches to pose research questions, solve problems and troubleshoot processes.</li>
<li>Identify avenues for improvements of fungi and fermentation parameters to drive growth, protein production, and desired phenotypes.</li>
<li>Design and execute experiments firsthand focused on fungal morphology, physiology, growth optimization, and nutrient requirements.</li>
<li>Identify major inputs in fermentation processes that impact product yield and quality. Including substrate components and preparation, fermentation parameters, and downstream processes.</li>
<li>Prepare SOPs for fermentation and downstream processing.</li>
<li>Optimize fermentation pipelines by continually running analyses for KPIs utilizing expertise, analytical equipment, and external analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qualifications and skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>M.Sc. or Ph.D. in microbiology, genetics, chemical engineering, or a related field with 2+ years of experience in fungal fermentation process development.</li>
<li>Microbial fermentation experience with bioreactors. Experience working with filamentous fungi is highly preferred. </li>
<li>Highly versed in statistical-guided experimental design and analysis. </li>
<li>Skilled at employing software and statistical platforms for the analysis of large data sets (e.g. JMP, Tableau, Spotfire, or R and Python).</li>
<li>A proactive and innovative mindset coupled with an enthusiasm to tweak, improve and optimize processes.</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a start-up environment and handling dynamic priorities and timelines. A self-driven individual who desires the fast pace and extreme collaboration of a young company.</li>
<li>Must provide proof of identification and eligibility to work in the United States of America.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working Conditions/Hazards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work is primarily performed in a development lab setting. Work environment is fast-paced with unique challenges faced daily.</li>
<li>Work requires the use of fine motor skills, standing for extended periods of time, reaching and twisting motions and lifting 50 pounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BMC team, you will have the opportunity to explore innovative techniques, approaches and ideas combining the future of food and sustainable agriculture. We can’t wait to change the world with you!</p>
