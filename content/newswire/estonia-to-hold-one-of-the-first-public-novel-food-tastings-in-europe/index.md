**Estonia, May 21, 2023** - [Accelerate Estonia](https://accelerateestonia.ee/), in collaboration with [ÄIO](https://aio.bio/) and [Gelatex](https://www.gelatex.com/), is pleased to announce one of Europe's first public novel food tastings, which will take place on May 23rd during the region's top startup and tech event [Latitude59](https://latitude59.ee/).

Innovating food production is one of the most impactful ways to reduce humanity’s footprint on the planet. Subsequently, by making the production of food more sustainable, we can also make the food we eat healthier and better tasting. Numerous companies in Estonia and worldwide are devising fresh and inventive approaches to produce the sustenance necessary for our survival (and pleasure). However, bringing these products to the market in the European Union can take upwards of 2 million euros and more than 2 years. This means that innovation in the food industry will take place somewhere else where the process is more straightforward and less risky for the novel food companies.

Accelerate Estonia has been working for the past year with ÄIO and Gelatex together with the relevant public sector entities to find ways for Estonia to pioneer the novel foods approval process by guiding deeptech companies through the regulatory hurdles, possibly using AI to analyse the regulations and past applications to gather insight in how to prepare for the approval process. This initiative enhances food security, fosters innovation and positions Estonia as a leader in food tech.

On May 23rd Latitude59 attendees will witness history with Estonia's first public novel food tasting, one of the first public tastings all across Europe. The tasting event will explore the current novel food approval process and feature dishes prepared by accomplished chef Johannes Hõimoja using novel food ingredients from ÄIO and Gelatex. The event will take place from 12:30 till 13:30 at the Latitude59 food court, participants will need the Latitude59 ticket to enter.

Spots for tastings are limited, but some Latitude59 participants will also be given the opportunity to be among the selected group of people, first to publicly taste novel food in Estonia. Participants will be informed about the product details, including the production process, ingredients and allergens, and will be required to sign a consent form regarding the tasting.
