<p><em><strong>The successful launch of a new skincare brand with the world's first egg-derived cell culture supernatant[1]</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Tokyo, Japan, June 1, 2022 </strong>— IntegriCulture Inc. (hereafter IntegriCulture), a Japanese cellular agriculture startup pioneering revolutionary advancements in cellular agriculture and aims for a sustainable world, today announced that CELLAMENT™[2], an egg-derived skincare ingredient utilizing its proprietary cell culture technology, has been adopted in new skincare brand l'oeuf by essensebase launched today by BASEPLUS Co., Ltd. This is the second skincare brands that CELLAMENT™ has been selected and formulated as a main active ingredient which even inspired the brand names[3] since its launch in April 2021.</p>
<p>Yuki Hanyu, CEO at IntegriCulture said: “Cellular agriculture is often spoken in the food context, but what must not be forgotten is that opportunities of cellular agriculture go beyond food. Examples include solid materials like leather, fur and fluid substances like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. As a leading cellular agriculture company, we would like to demonstrate such possibility with BASEPLUS’s ‘l'oeuf advanced serum’ and ‘l'oeuf enrich cream.’”</p>

<p><strong>About CELLAMENT™</strong><br />
IntegriCulture has developed the CulNet™ system, which produces growth factors and serum components that account for a large part of the cost of producing cultured meat. The culture supernatant obtained from this system includes various useful components necessary for culturing target cells (e.g., muscle cells and liver cells).</p>
<p>Since it was confirmed that the culture supernatant of chicken egg embryo extraembryonic membrane conditioned cells obtained at the development stage of this CulNet™ system is also useful for human skin[4], we have considered the stability as a cosmetic raw material. It was launched our original cosmetic ingredient CELLAMENT™, which designed to repair and rejuvenate the skin in April 2021.

<p><strong>About IntegriCulture Inc.</strong><br />
We aim to use our proprietary low-cost cell culture technology CulNet™ system as a new platform in the biotechnology field, and to use it in various fields such as foods and leather made up of animal cells. The CulNet™ system is a versatile cell culture platform technology that simulates the interaction between organs in animals (patented). Theoretically, this technology can cultivate all animal cells on a large scale and at low cost and is expected to be used for various purposes including cultured meat. At the lab scale, we have already achieved the production of serum components, which contributed to the high cost. By realizing in-house production of serum components, it is not necessary to use fetal bovine serum and growth factors, which are the main causes of high cost of conventional cell culture, and the cost of cell culture can be significantly reduced.
