NewFish, a leading New Zealand biotechnology venture developing natural nutrition from water for sports and advanced nutrition industries, has received funding from SOSV as part of entering IndieBio’s Batch 15 cohort in San Francisco.

NewFish is the first Australian and New Zealand biotech company to join IndieBio. As part of the biotech acceleration programme, NewFish is setting up a team laboratory and office in San Francisco from February 2024 onwards around IndieBio’s new headquarters in Dogpatch.

The move into San Francisco and the focus on the USA sports and active lifestyle nutrition market is timely for NewFish as it finalizes product market fit with global nutrition partners. NewFish founder Alex Worker explains, “IndieBio is an excellent validation platform for NewFish. SOSV is one of the world’s leading biotech funds and their ecosystem support is helping accelerate our scaleup plans and de-risk the remaining technology hurdles. We now expect to be supplying 10,000 tonnes of Marine Whey and specialized natural nutrition ingredients from water within the next five years.”

NewFish CTO, Dr Adrienne McKee, who is a local of San Francisco and lives in the Bay Area explains further, “We’re really excited to be growing our nutrition from water footprint in San Francisco and across the USA given its relevance for NewFish as the world’s leading sports and active lifestyle nutrition market. The complete nutrition profile of our licensable applications complement the very best applications made with dairy whey concentrates, where we are receiving a lot of inbound requests given our technology’s natural nutrition profile. It’s an exciting stage for our biotechnology nutrition startup”.

Batch 15 of the IndieBio programme concludes mid 2024 where NewFish hopes to have begun setting up scale production partnerships and secured growth funding.
