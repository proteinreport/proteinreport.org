<p>GARNER, N.C. – May 19, 2020––<a href="https://improvednature.com/">Improved Nature</a>, a plant-based protein company, is proud to share that it has earned the Safe Quality Food Certification for its Nature’s PRIME™ products. The SQF Certification is a food quality and safety program that is globally recognized in the food industry. The SQF food safety and quality codes are designed to meet industry, consumer, and regulatory requirements for all sectors of the food supply chain.</p>
<p>Improved Nature is honored to receive this certification as it signifies that its products can be sold worldwide and guarantees consumers that every Nature’s PRIME™ product purchased meets the top standards for food quality and safety. Its manufacturing facility is also certified Kosher and Halal.</p>
<p>This milestone is especially significant right now as food safety has been one of the top consumer concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the SQF Institute, while it’s highly unlikely to contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging, now more than ever it is important for the food industry to have Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS) based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles in place to manage food safety risks and prevent food contamination.</p>
<p>“Earning the SQF Certification is a direct result of our team’s hard work to ensure we’re safely producing superior food for consumers, which we know is of utmost importance during a time like this,” said President and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr. Rody Hawkins. “The certification process involves all aspects of food safety and security, beginning with our ingredient suppliers all the way to our customers. We closely monitor our plant proteins through SQF, Kosher, and Halal certifications to ensure that we are delivering the highest quality sustainable protein available on the market today.”</p>
<p>With poultry and beef shortages occurring nationwide due to the pandemic, Nielsen reported that meat alternative sales as a result increased 255% in the last week of March. Due to the increased demand for protein during the pandemic, Improved Nature has made its Nature’s PRIME™ products available <a href="https://improvednaturedirect.com/">online</a> for consumers and is offering free shipping in the U.S. for orders over $15.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a representative at Good Food Institute said that plant-based meat alternatives provide not only a great increase in food safety, but also in environmental sustainability. According to the United Nations, truly sustainable foods include the consideration of how the food is produced and its quality. Plant protein is a more efficient and scalable source of food for the growing global population. All Improved Nature proteins are sustainably sourced and provide healthy nutrition with no artificial ingredients.</p>
<p>Improved Nature is committed to providing Better Protein for a Better Planet™.</p>
