**Singapore, May 17, 2024** - Nutrition from Water™ (NXW), a pioneering biotechnology company dedicated to unlocking the nutritional potential of our planet's pristine waters, proudly announces its recent achievement of winning the esteemed 'Nutrition For Tomorrow' Award, sponsored by Cargill. The award was announced yesterday afternoon in Singapore during the Future Food Asia conference.

This accolade recognizes NXW's innovative approach to nutrition and its significant impact on global health that doesn’t cost the earth. 

As part of the award, NXW will gain access to invaluable in-house expertise and capabilities provided by Cargill, facilitating the realization and scalability of NXW's groundbreaking solutions. NXW will also have the opportunity to conduct a funded pilot trial, enabling the company to further refine and validate its Marine Whey™ prototypes and applications tailored to the Asia region and its diverse consumer base. 

“We’re receiving this award on behalf of a big team effort over the past three years. It’s an acknowledgement of everybody’s work, drive and grit here. And we’re just getting started!” remarked Alex Worker, Co-Founder of NXW. "This accolade underscores the transformative potential of our approach to nutrition, which is rooted in planet-conscious innovation and global collaboration. We are grateful to Cargill for their generous support and look forward to leveraging their expertise to accelerate the impact of our solutions on a global scale."

The award comes just a week after the company’s rebrand from NewFish to Nutrition from Water™ (NXW) which CEO Toby Lane explains reflects their mission to develop an entirely new nutrition category, utilizing non-extractive marine science. “Partnering with world-leading nutrition companies like Cargill is critical to building this category at the speed and scale that’s required.”
