<p>Food-tech start-ups are trailblazing the future of food. As talented innovators leverage new technologies to bring novel foods to consumers on a global scale, there has never been a more exciting time to touch, taste and smell the breakthrough novel foods.</p>
<p><a href="https://futurefoodtechsf.com/">Future Food-Tech</a> reveals 55 start-ups for your innovation radar, as they take the global summit spotlight in San Francisco on March 24-25.</p>
<p><em>“The wait is almost over! 55 food-tech innovators will vie for attention through innovation challenges, start-up pitches, product launches and tastings. This summit will bring you closer than ever to the future of food,”</em> says <strong>Jet</strong> <strong>Luckhurst</strong>, <em>Start-Up Partnerships Manager</em> at <strong>Future Food-Tech.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Entrepreneurs at the cutting edge of innovation present solutions including: precision fermentation, plant-based whole cuts, functional protein ingredients, food waste and cultured meat scaffolding:</em></strong></p>
