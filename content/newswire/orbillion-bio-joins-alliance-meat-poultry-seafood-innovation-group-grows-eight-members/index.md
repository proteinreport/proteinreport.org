<p class="text-align-center"><em>Orbillion Bio to become the eighth member of the Alliance for Meat, Poultry <span class="amp">&</span> Seafood Innovation, a coalition of food companies dedicated to producing meat, poultry and seafood directly from animal cells.</em></p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 15, 2021) – <strong>The Alliance for Meat, Poultry <span class="amp">&</span> Seafood Innovation (AMPS Innovation)</strong> announced the addition of a new member company, <a href="https://www.orbillion.com/"><strong>Orbillion Bio</strong></a>. Founded in August 2019 by <a href="https://www.bluenalu.com/"><strong>BlueNalu</strong></a>, <a href="https://finlessfoods.com/"><strong>Finless Foods</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.forkandgoode.com/"><strong>Fork <span class="amp">&</span> Goode</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us"><strong>JUST</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.upsidefoods.com/"><strong>UPSIDE Foods</strong></a>, Orbillion Bio becomes the eighth member of AMPS Innovation in addition to <strong><a href="https://artemysfoods.com/">Artemys Foods</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.newagemeats.com/">New Age Meats</a> </strong>who joined the Alliance in July 2020. AMPS Innovation is a coalition of cell-cultured meat, poultry, and seafood companies focused on educating consumers and stakeholders about their new industry and advocating for a clear path to market for their products.</p>

<p>Orbillion Bio was founded in 2019 by Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS, and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD and will focus on bringing premium cell-cultured meat such as wagyu beef, elk, sheep, and American bison to market. With the addition of Orbillion Bio, AMPS Innovation will continue coordinated efforts to engage key policymakers and stakeholders to educate them on their products and work with Congress, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as they continue to build out a regulatory framework for cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood.</p>

<p>“We’re committed to crafting cell-cultured meat that consumers trust and feel good about. That’s why we’re joining AMPS Innovation,” said Samet Yildirim, Orbillion Bio Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer. “As a member of the coalition, we’re thrilled to work with industry partners to communicate with consumers, educate industry stakeholders, and inform a clear path to market.”</p>

<p>For nearly two years, AMPS Innovation has met and engaged with numerous policymakers on both sides of the aisle and continued productive conversations with USDA and FDA. AMPS Innovation also has worked closely with representatives from the traditional meat and seafood industries – North American Meat Institute and the National Fisheries Institute – to send letters to the USDA and FDA to <a href="https://ampsinnovation.org/amps-innovation-and-nami-letter-to-fsis/">solicit input</a> on what that labeling should look like through an Advance Notice of Public Rulemaking and <a href="https://ampsinnovation.org/nfi-ampsinnovation-fda-comments-030821/">in response</a> to the FDA’s Labeling of Foods Comprised of or Containing Cultured Seafood Cells Request for Information, respectively.</p>

<p>All eight member companies, and other companies in this new and emerging industry expect to make products available in the U.S. soon through appropriate regulatory pathways. AMPS Innovation member companies are committed to being a central, unified resource for consumers, stakeholders and policymakers as their industry advances. Building on progress over the past year, AMPS Innovation will continue to serve as the voice of the industry as it establishes itself as a safe, sustainable complement to the traditional meat, poultry and seafood markets.</p>
