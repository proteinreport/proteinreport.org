<p>Leading plant-based meat companies in Australia including Sanitarium, Proform Foods, v2food, Rogue Foods and Nestlé Australia, along with the U.S.’s Impossible Foods, have launched the Alternative Proteins Council (APC), a new representative group for Australia’s alternative proteins sector.</p>
<p>The new membership group provides a forum for Australia’s alternative proteins sector to explore common issues and opportunities and aims to ensure the sector’s collective voice remains strong and unified on key issues as it evolves.</p>
<p>Australia’s independent think tank and expert advisor on alternative proteins, Food Frontier, is also a founding member of the APC and will act as secretariat. Additional alternative protein companies are anticipated to join in coming months, a reflection of the industry’s recent growth.</p>
<p>Deloitte Access Economics (DAE) modelling in Food Frontier’s 2020 State of the Industry valued the Australian plant-based meat industry, one portion of the broader alternative proteins sector, at $185 million in sales, following a 46 percent increase in grocery sales and doubling of products on shelves in FY20. DAE’s FY19 growth modelling forecasts the domestic industry to reach almost $3 billion in sales by 2030, in a moderate scenario.</p>
<p>Food Frontier’s Director of Policy and Government Relations Sam Lawrence said establishing the APC marks an evolution in Australia’s alternative proteins sector. He noted the importance of a unified voice on matters of common interest, such as the recent working group initiated by the Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud through the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to review plant-based product labelling.</p>
<p>Mr Lawrence said, “The plant-based meat sector has taken a collaborative and evidence-based approach to best serve the interests of consumers around issues including product labelling. The APC formalises our collaboration to support the 29 companies comprising Australia’s alternative proteins sector to engage at a national level on policy issues, enabling the sector’s shared vision and continuing to serve Australians who enjoy alternative protein products.”</p>
