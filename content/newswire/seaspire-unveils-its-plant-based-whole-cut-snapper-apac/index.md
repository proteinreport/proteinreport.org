<p>June 17, 2022 — SeaSpire, an Indian alternative seafood startup, today revealed its clean label whole-cut snapper alternative made using only seven clean label plant-based ingredients using its proprietary bioprinting platform. The company claims to be first of its kind to produce bioprinted whole-cut whitefish products in the APAC region, a region lagging in both product and processing innovations in the alternative seafood segment.</p>
<p>SeaSpire is a foodtech company that produces whole cuts of seafood alternatives, starting with whole cut snapper analogs. The company was founded to help address the current challenges in whole-cut production and scalability of 3D printing with its technology platform that is capable of structuring both plant and synthetic biomass such as cultivated meat into whole-muscle through AI-controlled precision and  improving production scale by increasing throughput from current scale of 3D printing. </p>
<p>The company is establishing an operational base in India to cater to the APAC region. The plant-based meat consumer adoption in the Indian-subcontinent is on its rise and the company is  optimistic that this region will also experience similar growth in demand across the alternative</p>
<p>Seafood category  in the coming years. They have their R&D base in New Zealand where they conduct technology development  within New Zealand’s sound innovation ecosystem. With a rich heritage in food tech and animal proteins and strong Oceania brand story as a legacy protein producer working towards a sustainable protein transition. </p>
<p>Over the coming months the company will pilot-launch its first set of plant-based seafood offerings in India and New Zealand starting with a plant-based whole-cut snapper filets and focus on building an alternative-seafood brand in the emerging APAC markets including Singapore and Australasia. </p>
<p>“-- <em>We see greenfield  opportunities when it comes to alt-seafoods in the largest seafood consuming regions like India and south-east Asia. Weaim to drive category growth in this region with  a range of healthy and delectable alt-seafood starting with our whole-muscle whitefish fillets', says co-founder Shantanu Dhangar.</em></p>
<p>SeaSpire focuses on technologies that can displace the inefficiencies with seafood production with a strong emphasis on the global food supply towards a circular economy. The company is investigating potential of upcycled horticultural side streams to develop feedstock for their alternative seafood wholecuts. </p>
<p><em>“--We need smart proteins and even a smarter production infrastructure to address sustainable food transition for future generations. Reducing supply chain stress, ingredient innovations and upcycling feedstock are supporting pillars for our success at SeaSpire”, says co-founder Varun Gadodia. </em></p>
<p><em>The company will be showcasing its products at Tomorrow’s Protein Summit - by XPRIZE Foundation later this year and is aiming for its plant-based whitefish wholecuts market launch in early 2023.</em></p>
