<p><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands — May 10, 2023. </strong>Farmless, a Dutch startup, is using fermentation to produce carbon-negative, functional proteins with a complete amino acid profile. This technology, which will decouple food production from agricultural land, is backed by a €1.2 million pre-seed round led by Revent, Nucleus Capital, and Possible Ventures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fermentation platform is based on liquid feedstock made with CO2, hydrogen and renewable energy</li>
<li>Initial product is a functional protein that provides all essential amino acids and </li>
<li>Requires 500x less land than animal protein</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of using sugar, Farmless is pushing the fermentation frontier using a liquid feedstock which can be made with renewable energy. This makes Farmless’ process dramatically more resource- and land efficient than animal farming, requiring 10-25x less land than plant protein and 250-500x less than animal protein.</p>
<p>The €1.2 million pre-seed round was co-led by Revent, Nucleus Capital, Possible Ventures with participation from HackCapital, Sustainable Food Ventures, VOYAGERS Climate-Tech Fund, TET Ventures and angels Jenny Saft through the Atomico Angel program, Ron Shigeta, Martin Weber, Rick Bernstein, Nadine Geiser, Joy Faucher, Michele Tarawneh, Alexander Hoffmann and Christian Stiebner.</p>
<p><em>"We're excited by the Farmless approach to fermentation. We're specifically interested in food technologies with high scalability and the potential to rapidly outperform on the cost per kg of protein. Across both of these dimensions Farmless shows great potential and it's a delight to work with this remarkable team,"</em> says Lauren Lentz from Revent.</p>
<p><em>"We’re proud to be backed by an amazing group of experienced climate tech investors who share our mission. With our fermentation platform we aim to dramatically outperform animal agriculture and reliably produce low-cost proteins at a planetary scale. We believe this technology has the potential to end factory farming, rewild our planet and draw down gigatons of carbon," </em>explains Adnan Oner, the founder and CEO of Farmless.</p>
<p><strong>A new food repertoire</strong></p>
<p>Farmless' initial products are designed to replace animal proteins, as the majority of agricultural land is currently used to feed animals. The Farmless fermentation platform can potentially create a whole new food repertoire, producing proteins, carbohydrates, beneficial fats, vitamins, and minerals from the bottom up.</p>
<p><strong>About Farmless & The age of electric agriculture</strong></p>
<p>Farmless’ mission is to free food production from animals and agricultural land. The company’s goal is to build a fermentation platform which can turn renewable electricity into food. Farmless was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnanoner/"><u>Adnan Oner</u></a>, a physicist and serial entrepreneur with a mission to create a future worth getting excited about. <br />
