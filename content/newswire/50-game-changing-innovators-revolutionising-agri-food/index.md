<p><strong><em>Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit, Singapore, October 26-28</em></strong></p>
<p>SINGAPORE — The fifth annual <strong>Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit</strong> presents 50 regional and international innovators who are pioneering breakthrough technologies in agri-food, to ensure food security and build capacity in Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>Asia’s agri-food system needs help. With global shocks highlighting import link weaknesses, rapid economic growth, and huge structural transformation across the region, the need to build strong, resilient supply chains has never been more urgent.</p>
<p><em>“Given the complex challenges Asia's food system faces, the need for fast-paced, scalable innovation has never been greater. The summit creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to connect directly with investors and corporate partners, to bring their solutions to scale and change the agri-food landscape for the benefit of all. I am excited to witness the collaborations stemming from the conference this October”</em> says Theresa Flach, the summit’s Conference Producer and technology scout.</p>
<p>Start-ups are celebrated throughout the summit programme, with a pre-summit pitch day, themed innovation showcases across the three-day agenda, and a dedicated start-up exhibition space.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation Showcases</strong></p>
<p>12 start-ups from the Asia-Pacific region will pitch their solution to a panel of industry judges across four themed innovation showcases covering Agtech, Foodtech, Aquaculture and CEA & Vertical Farming.</p>
<p><strong><em>AgTech Takes the Stage</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qzense</strong> (India) aims to minimise and eliminate post-harvest food loss with its IoT solution that quickly and accurately grades fresh food. The technology employs a unique combination of near-infrared spectral sensors and olfactory sensors for analysis of internal spoilage, ripeness, sweetness, and shelf life.</li>
<li><strong>Boomitra</strong> (India & US) uses satellite and AI to measure a variety of soil properties including soil carbon, soil moisture and nitrogen, and provides an end-to-end solution where farmers are able to grow more with less through carbon farming.</li>
<li><strong>CH4 Global </strong>(Australia) provides seaweed-based Asparagopsis products to farmers worldwide so they can dramatically reduce the methane emissions of their livestock and realize significant value in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>CEA & Vertical Farming Spotlight</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Future Farms</strong> (Malaysia) aims to season-proof agriculture by building decentralized, remote-controlled farms. Future Farms promise that their services provide endless customization and are infinitely scalable.</li>
<li><strong>Grobrix</strong> (Singapore) presents a unique solution to indoor farming by combining the best of furniture with farming. Its soilless vertical farming design offers a cleaner, simpler, more efficient way to grow fresh, healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Distar Fresh</strong> (Thailand) is a subscription service indoor farm that delivers pesticide-free medical grade vegetables from farm to door that are harvested all-year round.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Blue Food Shark Tank</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forte Biotech</strong> (Singapore) provides diagnostic solutions to allow prawn farmers to ‘earn more’, with its patented product ‘RAPID’ (Robust Accurate Prawn Infection Detector) – developed in partnership with NUS – that enables farmers to detect diseases early and take mitigative action without the need for expert help.</li>
<li><strong>Sea Green</strong> (Singapore) is an ecosystem services provider, with a mission to deliver connectivity and services to the growing seaweed industry. Using blockchain technology, the company will maximise financial service integration for smallholders, and harness data to drive research into the potential of macroalgae.</li>
<li><strong>Magalarva</strong> (Indonesia) aims to provide sustainable protein for feed by bio-converting organic sidestreams using Black Soldier Fly larvae. The company is closing the loop by eliminating organic waste from producers including food and beverage factories, hotels and plantations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Raising the Stakes in Food-Tech</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SeaSpire</strong> (India) blends cutting-edge technologies, digital tools and nutrition packed plant-based ingredients to develop plant-based cousins of the world's favourite marine species. SeaSpire's bioprinting tech promises whole muscle structures with no compromise on taste, texture and affordability.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Valley</strong> (Australia) is an Australian food company developing healthy and delicious cultivated meat products. Focused on building a better global food system, Magic Valley believes the solution is cultivated meat, where meat is grown without the animal.</li>
<li><strong>Float Foods</strong> (Singapore) is a company that believes in the power of plants. Singaporeans consume 2 billion eggs per year, but 74% of them are imported, a fact that became a problem during the pandemic - which is when Float Foods started developing Asia's first plant-based whole egg, OnlyEg.</li>
