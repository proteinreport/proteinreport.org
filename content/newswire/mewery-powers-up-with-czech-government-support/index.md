**Brno, Czech Republic – January 26, 2024** – Mewery, a Czech startup pioneering the development of cultivated meat using a groundbreaking bio-hybrid culture system, announced that it had received nearly 200k€ grant from the Czech government via the CzechInvest (Government Business and Investment Development Agency) Technological Incubator. This funding will enable Mewery to conduct selected comprehensive studies on the process of their cultivated meat production and prepare for a bigger scale-up. It represents non-dilutive support and complements the primary funding Mewery has received from angel investors and venture capital funds.

“The CzechInvest ’s investment is a significant endorsement of Mewery’s innovative approach to cultivated meat,” said Roman Lauš, Founder and CEO of Mewery. “With this funding, we can gain valuable insights into the production process, enabling us to optimize our cultivation methods.”

The grant will be used to characterize parts of the bioprocess. This will involve basic characterization, metabolomics, and transcriptomics approaches for the analysis of the growth of cells and their interactions.

“This knowledge will be essential for designing a near-future scalable production process that is efficient, cost-effective, and meets the highest quality standards,” explained Lauš.

The funding will also allow Mewery to gather a partial set of data needed to obtain authorities’ safety approval in the future. This includes data on the nutritional composition of the biomass, as well as data on individual components of the production.

“We are grateful to the CzechInvest for their support,” said Lauš. “With their backing, we are confident that Mewery can make significant contributions to the cultivated meat industry and provide consumers with a sustainable, ethical, and healthier alternative to conventional pork and beyond.”
