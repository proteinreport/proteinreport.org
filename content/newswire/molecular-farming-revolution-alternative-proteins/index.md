<p><strong>Moolec Science is a global pioneer using molecular farming to introduce a hybrid concept between plant-based and cell-based technologies in the alternative proteins space.</strong></p>
<p><em>Warwick, UK – November 2020</em>. Moolec Science is a newly formed Ag-Foodtech company consolidating a unique pipeline of projects and capabilities in the Molecular Farming space, with more than one decade under development.</p>
<p><em>“Our mission is to improve the affordability of animal-free solutions in favour of true sustainability. We promote a technology that will have the cost structure of plant-based solutions with the organoleptic properties and functionality of cell-based platforms, an approach at least 10x more cost effective than leading alternatives” </em>states Gastón Paladini, CEO & Co-Founder.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>“Molecular Farming is a technology that has not yet been fully explored in the alternative proteins landscape. Moolec </em><em>will promote an inclusive and equitable technological platform as we aim to bring farmers back into the equation”</em> declares Henk Hoogenkamp, CPO & Co-Founder.</p>
<p>With a proof of concept for the cheese market, the team is known for being the first to produce bovine chymosin in safflower, a functional protein commercialized under the SPC® brand. A family of international patents currently covers this platform, with SPC® events fully de-regulated for cost-effective large-scale production.</p>
<p><em>“We use plants as bioreactors”,</em> says CTO & Co-Founder Martín Salinas. <em>“Our experience and scientific background made us conclude that we could take advantage of nature's biological systems to design a resource-efficient alternative protein production platform”. </em></p>
<p>Currently, the company is consolidating different research lines to produce unique blends of highly functional proteins from bovine and porcine origins in protein-rich crops such as soybean and peas, creating a new generation of meat analogues. Moolec’s main and initial focus is on food technologies, although Molecular Farming solutions can also target industries such as health, biomaterials, and biocosmetics.</p>
<p>Moolec Science is company run by a diverse team with operations in the United States, Europe, and South America. It has the support and financial backing of various investors such as Bioceres Ventures and Union Group.</p>
