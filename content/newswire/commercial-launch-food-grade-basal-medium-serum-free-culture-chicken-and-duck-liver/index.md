description: "IntegriCulture Inc. performed the first successful cultivation of chicken and duck liver-derived cells in a serum-free basal medium by the CulNet system, which emulates natural inter-organ interactions. The cost of cultivation using IntegriCulture’s basal medium (product name: I-MEM) and CulNet system has been estimated to be about 1/60 of media using animal serum. The company aims to launch cell-cultured foie gras this year as its first line of cell-cultured meat products."
