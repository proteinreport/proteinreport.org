NEW YORK, May 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --- [Gathered
Foods](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2809829-1&h=2473377282&u=http%3A%2F%2Fgatheredfoods.com%2F&a=Gathered+Foods),
makers of [Good
Catch®](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2809829-1&h=1464719621&u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodcatchfoods.com%2F&a=Good+Catch%C2%AE) plant-based
seafood products, today announced a new group of celebrity investors
bolstering the growth of the rising company. The dynamic roster
includes Woody Harrelson, Shailene Woodley, Paris Hilton and Lance Bass,
all of whom come from diverse backgrounds to share their passion and
support for the future of the plant-based industry.

The plant-based trend has cultivated an immense movement in recent
years, with the category reaching a value of \$4.5 billion and retail
sales of plant-based foods growing by 11 percent in 2019 (vs. two
percent for the overall retail food market)^1^. As consumer demand for
protein alternatives continues to soar, the support from each of these
stars towards protecting animal welfare and bettering the world's oceans
shows the impact is more than just a trend: It's a lifestyle change that
has staying power.

"I've been living a vegan lifestyle for over 30 years. My diet has been
driven by the love I have for the environment," said Actor Woody
Harrelson. "I have known Chad Sarno for years and am a huge fan of the
culinary work Chad and his brother Derek are driving in the market. I'm
excited to work with a food brand like Good Catch that leads with taste
and aligns with my personal beliefs of making a difference for the
animals and our planet."

As plant-based meat products continue to become household names, there
is a clear need for plant-based seafood options that aid in easing the
damage caused by the overfishing of our world's oceans. The Gathered
Foods team recognized this necessity when creating Good Catch. It's
plant-based tuna offers the taste, texture, nutrition, and experience of
seafood without the adverse environmental harm.

"As an advocate for conservation, our planet and its oceans, I work with
organizations around the world to help combat climate change and protect
our oceans from pollution. That's why aligning with Good Catch feels
like a natural extension of my continued work," said Actress Shailene
Woodley. "They are a like-minded brand that is doing their part to have
a positive impact on our oceans and our planet, all while creating
delicious plant-based seafood alternatives. I'm excited to see what
innovative products they come up with next."

The elevated culinary experience of Good Catch products has quickly
drawn the attention of consumers and investors alike, with this group of
notable advocates joining on the heels of a \$36.8 million Series
B [financing

This round, combined with the new backing from Woody Harrelson, Shailene
Woodley, Paris Hilton and Lance Bass signifies the overwhelming belief
in the future of plant-based seafood.

"Consumer demand and culinary trends show the evolving excitement for
plant-based foods, and the unified support from such an influential
group goes far beyond funding alone," said Chris Kerr, CEO and
Co-Founder of Gathered Foods. "The message underscored by their backing
is invaluable. We are thrilled to welcome all of our new investors and
are hopeful for the growth and continued innovation their
endorsement creates."

The Good Catch brand continues to grow as its products are now available
in over 4,500 retail outlets across the United States and the UK, with
plans for additional international retail partners later this year.
