**San Francisco** - Nutrition from Water™ (NXW), a leading New Zealand and Indie Bio-backed nutrition company developing natural nutrition from pristine waters, is joining [MISTA](https://mistafood.com/) as a startup member. MISTA is a San Francisco-based open innovation food technology ecosystem with numerous multinational members including [Givaudan](https://www.givaudan.com/), Buhler, Danone, Conagra, Ingredion, SIG, and others. Startups that have recently scaled through the MISTA ecosystem include NotCo, Geltor, and Yali Bio. The MISTA partnership comes off the back of NXW winning Cargill’s Nutrition for Tomorrow Award 2024 in Singapore at Future Food Asia in May 2024. 

Announcing the launch of NXW’s first product samples into the USA, Marine Whey™, there will be an invitation-only applications session held at MISTA Foods 2pm PST on Friday, 14 June 2024. The NXW team will be sampling Marine Whey™ solutions designed for affordable, everyday nutrition applications. Companies or investors with a mandate for nutrition impact and scalable climate technologies are welcome to register for the event at info@nutritionfromwater.com.

NXW CEO Toby Lane explains, “*Alongside our current headquarters at IndieBio SF in dogpatch, we’re excited to be joining MISTA Foods to showcase our affordable, high quality, and complete nutrition designed in New Zealand. We’re working with global partners in coalition to manufacture non-GMO nutrition from water that doesn’t compromise on deliciousness, function, and price. We’re finalizing our Marine Whey™ prototypes and planning to supply many tonnes over the coming year to prioritized coalition partners, and we’re having fun with the MISTA ecosystem testing various applications. Our Marine Whey™ behaves and functions just like high-quality dairy whey, with a much smaller environmental footprint and a price point at scale that allows us to feed millions of growing families across Africa, Asia Pacific, and the Americas. We’re eager to collaborate under the MISTA umbrella, testing and learning in partnership with experts worldwide*.”
