<p><strong>Future Food-Tech presents revolutionary solutions set to shake-up the food industry</strong></p>
<p>The food industry is quickly adapting to today’s consumer demands, developing new technologies and bringing products to market faster than ever before. New start-ups are emerging on the food-tech scene with bold new concepts and fresh approaches to transform the future of food.</p>
<p>It’s more important than ever for the Future Food-Tech summit to showcase fresh talent ripe for investment and partnerships, as the industry gathers once again on December 2-3, 2020.</p>
<p>“There has never been a greater need for new technologies to accelerate the future of food. We are excited to unveil the standout solutions that are spearheading the next generation of food-tech innovation at the summit this December,” says Jet Luckhurst, Technology Scout at Future Food-Tech.</p>
<p>With a proven track-record for scouting the most exciting and freshest technologies, the summit unveils twelve innovators offering unique approaches to meet the industry’s hottest challenges.</p>
<p><strong>PRIORITIZING HEALTH AND NUTRITION</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE: Accelerate cell-based products to market</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.orbillion.com/">Orbillion Bio</a> is building an advanced bioplatform for functional testing of cell lines for cultivated meat – a solution that is ready for rapid scalability and wide-spread adoption. “Our mission is to bring healthy, ethical, and flavorful cultivated meat with a story to the modern consumer,” explains Patricia Bubner, CEO and Co-Founder at <a href="https://www.orbillion.com/">Orbillion Bio</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> More natural, functional ingredients for clean label products</p>
<p>“Consumers want real foods made with real food ingredients, not synthetic additives,” states Chris Gregson, Founder at <a href="http://paragonpure.com/">Pargon Pure</a>. By working <em>with</em> nature to enhance the nutrition, sustainability and authenticity of packaged foods, Paragon Pure creates high-performance specialty flours by guiding traditional grain sprouting processes towards precise functional properties. Its flours can be used to replace additives and deliver natural flavors, colors and nutrients into wholesome foods.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Natural healthy ingredients from upcycled agri-food waste</strong></p>
<p>Tait Labs produces sustainable food and pharma ingredients upcycled from natural sources by unlocking the health potential trapped in the 4 million tons of mandarin orange peel produced annually. “We are ready to share our vision of how it tackles the two massive problems of food waste and chronic disease,” says Andrew Tait, CEO of <a href="https://herring-eagle-mm93.squarespace.com/">Tait Labs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NEXTGEN PLANT-BASED </strong></p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Recreate the texture and mouthfeel of whole-cut plant-based meats</strong></p>
<p>Bevo is a food-technology company that has developed a process and designed a proprietary machine that can transform any plant-based protein powder into a muscle-like fibrous structure that can then be shaped into delicious steaks. “We can currently produce beef, pork and chicken-like steaks with a lab-scale capacity,” notes Tilen Travnik, CEO at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bevo-tech/">Bevo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Transform plant-based dairy innovation</strong></p>
<p>''At Those Vegan Cowboys, we create the ultimate follow-up to traditional dairy by expressing casein genes in yeast and fungi. Caseins are then produced large scale by grass-fed fermentation,” details Jaap Korteweg, CEO at <a href="https://thosevegancowboys.com/">Those Vegan Cowboys</a> and founding father of <a href="https://www.thevegetarianbutcher.com/">The Vegetarian Butcher</a>. This pioneering CEO is taking the next step in dairy production, from hand milking, via the milking machine to the fully automatic milking robot of today.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Make plant-based foods tastier, healthier and more sustainable</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelivegreenco.com/">The Live Green Co</a> is disrupting the way the world consumes by recommending 100% natural plant alternatives for the animal as well as synthetic and highly-processed additives in our daily foods. “The Live Green Co is participating in the TechHub at Future Food-Tech to scout for like-minded production and distribution partners globally, along with networking with industry peers,” shares Pri Srinivas, Founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.thelivegreenco.com/">The Live Green Co</a>.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE IS DATA AND AI</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE: Use AI to develop next-generation protein-based ingredients</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.proterabio.com/">Protera</a> has created a process called Natural Intelligence™, which takes advantage of proprietary AI algorithms to craft functional proteins. "We are leveraging our deep learning technology to shine a light on a previously untapped universe of functional proteins. Our team is developing next-generation clean-label texturizing and food-preserving proteins," explains Leonardo Alvarez, Founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.proterabio.com/">Protera</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Use AI and data-powered genomics to match ingredients to products</strong></p>
<p>“The basis of food is an ingredient, and the basis of human life is a gene. By leading the way in understanding and mapping the relationship between ingredients and human genes, we are making food as medicine a reality,” says Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, CEO at <a href="https://www.canomiks.com/">Canomiks</a>. The company is the first technology company using genomics, bioinformatics, and an AI-based technology platform to test and certify biological efficacy and safety of ingredients and formulations.</p>
<p><strong>NOVEL TECHNOLOGY, INGREDIENTS AND APPROACHES</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Accelerate development of novel ingredients</strong></p>
<p> “<a href="http://zymtronix.com/">Zymtronix</a> packs and deploys enzymes as green catalysts, making ingredients more efficiently and precisely than chemistry or fermentation,” says Stephane Corgie, CEO at <a href="http://zymtronix.com/">Zymtronix</a>. The breakthrough enzyme immobilization platform improves the activity, stability and reusability of any enzyme to tackle the complex production of novel ingredients while developing efficient processes and lowering costs.</p>

Its proprietary ACTivation technology makes it possible to extract the key elements of the barrel that enhance aroma, color and taste (ACT) but with precision, control and speed.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Next generation alternatives to plastic packaging</strong> </p>
<p> “Using a novel approach and solid polymer science, <a href="https://www.stencollc.com/">StenCo</a> is utilizing inexpensive, nature-based materials to address some of today's most pressing environmental issues,” notes John Brown, CEO at <a href="https://www.stencollc.com/">StenCo</a>. The company has developed an oxygen barrier better than most plastics to keep food fresh.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> <strong>Low cost material identification and ingredients analysis</strong></p>
<p>“<a href="https://senorics.com/">Senorics</a> develops small, powerful and low-cost material sensing sensors to provide insights into the composition of food and beverages. Now, we are looking to connect with industry leaders to identify high impact and beneficial applications to the benefit of organizations and consumers alike,” explains Robert Langer, CCO at <a href="https://senorics.com/">Senorics</a>.
