<p>The first edition of <a href="https://mylkcubator.com/">Mylkcubator</a>, the incubation program launched by <a href="https://pascualinnoventures.com/"><strong>Pascual Innoventures</strong></a> in collaboration with<a href="https://www.eatableadventures.com/"><strong> Eatable Adventures</strong></a>, has held its eagerly anticipated Demo Day event showcasing the advances of the first cohort of startups, at its headquarters in Manoteras, Madrid.</p>
<p>The program not only showcased pioneering dairy projects around the world but also <strong>laid the foundation for a new path of development and innovation for the industry</strong> to face some of its greatest challenges.</p>
<p>As a culmination of the six-month incubation program, the participating startups presented their final pitches, <strong>paving the way for future funding rounds</strong> that will allow them to pursue their innovative development and research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://denovodairy.com/">De Novo Dairy,</a> a startup</strong> based in South Africa with a mission to create the future of nutrition, the company uses precise fermentation technology to produce animal-free dairy proteins that provide the same sensory experience and nutrition as traditional dairy counterparts. De Novo Dairy is currently developing high-value proteins for the dairy industry.</li>
<li>Spanish startup <a href="https://www.realdealmilk.com/"><strong>Real Deal Milk</strong></a> develops casein and whey proteins through precision fermentation technologies with the same functional properties as traditional dairy components, with the aim to produce dairy substitutes equivalent to traditional dairy.</li>
<li>Using bioengineering & microbial fermentation, <a href="https://zerocowfactory.com/"><strong>Zero Cow Factory</strong></a> is reinventing dairy ingredients with India’s first milk and milk products (certainly the world’s first A2 milk protein) using bioengineering the microbes & microbial fermentation. The Zero Cow team is developing a proprietary technique to recreate milk proteins to develop real dairy products that are ethical, safe, delicious, and identical to cow milk.</li>
<li><strong>Pure™ Mammary Factors</strong> based in the USA are accelerating the state of the art in cell-cultured dairy by crashing the cost of production by the development of growth factors used in culture media. The startup aims to make cell-cultured human milk affordable and accessible by selling food-grade off-the-shelf growth factors around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pascual Innoventures</strong> is committed to driving innovation to create a more sustainable future for all, anticipating the current trends that will shape the foods of the future. Due to the success of the first edition of Mylkcubator, Pascual Innoventures has already announced the call for the second edition of the program.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Sejal Ravji</strong>, director of Pascual Innoventures, <em>“the success of the Mylkcubator Demo Day not only reaffirms the great response this program has had in the sector worldwide but also confirms what we at Innoventures already knew, in order to develop the dairy products of the future we have to continue to invest in transformational innovation and ambitious technological projects, as is the case with the four startups that have been working with us since the start of Mylkcubator six months ago”.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, according to <strong>Jose Luis Cabañero</strong>, founder and CEO of Eatable Adventures, <em>“In the coming years, we expect to see increased innovation in the alternative protein space, with breakthroughs in cellular agriculture and precision fermentation technologies. Mylkcubator is a pioneering global program that is and will continue to be at the forefront of developing the dairy of the future.”</em></p>
