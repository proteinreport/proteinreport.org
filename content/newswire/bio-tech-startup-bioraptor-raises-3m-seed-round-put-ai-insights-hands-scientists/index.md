<p>Tel Aviv, Israel - [October 31, 2022] Today BioRaptor announces a $3M funding round to innovate the biotech industry by putting the power of AI-generated insights into the hands of every scientist.</p>
<p>The round was led by lool Ventures and CPT Capital and was joined by FoodHack and a number of strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>BioRaptor is building the operating system for biology research and manufacturing - leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to present a clear understanding of data and creating deep, actionable insights, integrated within existing workflows. BioRaptor is already improving its customer’s bottom line. With this round, BioRaptor will ramp up development and onboard additional customers.</p>
<p>Whilst synthetic biology approaches offer incredible potential for some of humanity’s greatest problems, the path from scientific research to commercialisation is a long and difficult  journey. Stakeholders face huge technical challenges and often lack the requisite tools to guide them on an optimal path for a cost-effective, quality product. BioRaptor helps scientists and biotechnologists innovate faster.</p>
<p>“Scientists are spending so much time on manual analysis rather than focusing on planning and research. As a software engineer, I’ve experienced first hand the shift in the past 15 years and we’ve come to take for granted the work that’s been offloaded from us via advanced tools. We want to bring that to Biology.” said <strong>Ori Zakin</strong>, <strong>BioRaptor</strong>’s co-founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"BioRaptor truly shows how AI and Big data enable scientists to accelerate innovation and impact our lives for the better.  We are thrilled to join Ori and Yaron on this journey, and to see how their product empowers the scientific community across FoodTech, drug discovery, synthetic biology industries, and beyond.” <strong>Avichay Nissenbaum, </strong>General Partner,<strong> lool ventures</strong></p>
<p>“As experienced investors in alternative proteins, we have seen the challenges in bringing synthetic biology products to market. Under Ori and Yaron’s leadership,  we believe the BioRaptor platform can play a critical role in enabling the world’s most disruptive and innovative companies to commercialise their products in a quicker, cost-effective manner’. <strong>Harry Kalms</strong>, Investor, <strong>CPT Capital</strong></p>
<p>“We hear from so many companies working with different fermentation techniques who need an end-to-end data tool across their development and production process. We are excited to back BioRaptor who have a proven track record in the medical industry, and are now enabling FoodTech companies to use data-driven insights to lead better experiments and increase their yield.” <strong>Erika Hombert,</strong> Venture Analyst, <strong>FoodHack Syndicate</strong></p>
