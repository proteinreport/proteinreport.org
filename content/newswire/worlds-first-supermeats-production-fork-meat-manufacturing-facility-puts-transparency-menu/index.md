<h2><strong><em>SuperMeat showcases production-to-fork meat manufacturing model for the first time, enabling transparency for meat consumers</em></strong></h2>

<p><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel (March 18, 2021)</strong> Food tech company <a href="https://supermeat.com/">SuperMeat</a> has launched the world’s first production-to-fork cultured meat manufacturing facility. The facility was introduced at a live event at the <a href="https://futurefoodtechsf.com/">Future Food-Tech</a> conference, where the cultured meat manufacturing process was demonstrated from chicken cell to chicken burger for the first time. During the event, the company announced that they have cut down their production cost by 50%, bringing a 100% cultured meat burger down to $30.</p>

<p>The venue provides meat consumers an unprecedented opportunity to observe the meat manufacturing process while dining on a menu based on cultured chicken. The indoor production-to-fork facility can produce hundreds of kilograms of meat every week, eliminating transportation, shortening the supply chain, reducing GHG emissions, saving land and providing high levels of transparency, increasing trust for poultry consumers.</p>

<p>SuperMeat believes that providing high transparency and traceability should be a cornerstone of food production. The launch of the production-to-fork facility showcases SuperMeat’s commitment in that direction and the potential that cellular agriculture technologies can bring to the meat industry. An <a href="https://www.specialityfoodmagazine.com/food-and-drink/brand-transparency-will-drive-sales#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20by%20Innova,about%20where%20foods%20come%20from.&text=As%20such%2C%20consumers%20want%20more,they%20purchase%20than%20ever%20before.%E2%80%9D">Innova Market Insights report</a> says transparency will be one of the top trends for the food and drink industry in 2021.

<p>According to CEO Ido Savir, “SuperMeat is working closely with local industries in the US, EU and UAE, to launch facilities similar to The Chicken around the world in 2022.”</p>
