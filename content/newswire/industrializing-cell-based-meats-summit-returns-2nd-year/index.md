<p>The <a href="https://industrializingcellbasedmeats.com/?utm_source=external-protein-report&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=14821-icbm-protein-report-press-release">Industrializing Cell-Based Meats Summit</a> returns for the 2nd year to unite the world’s leading minds from industry, academia and regulation to share the latest scientific progress in the field.</p>

<p>This industry-led forum joins key opinion leaders in the cellular agricultural space to have an open, honest and science-based discussion about key challenges in this field and to collaborate on how we can overcome crucial bottlenecks, from scaling up complex processes to producing sustainable, real-tasting meat.</p>

<p>You can download the complete agenda and expert speaker faculty in the Event Guide <a href="https://industrializingcellbasedmeats.com/program/full-event-guide/?utm_source=external-protein-report&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=14821-icbm-protein-report-press-release">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cell-based meat, poultry and seafood is being put forward as a solution that will help fulfil the increased demand for meat as the global population grows to 10 billion people by 2050. It will also provide significant benefits for the environment, animal welfare and public health.</p>

<p>In recent years, cultured meat products have gained momentum, with Mark Post having produced the first cell-based beef hamburger in 2013, Memphis Meats debuted the world’s first cell-based meatball in 2016 and more recently, JUST Inc. unveiled their lab-grown chicken nuggets in October 2019. In between these, various companies have also revealed prototypes including duck, steak, pork sausage, and fish cakes.</p>

<p>Investment in the space has skyrocketed, most recently with Dutch start up Meatable raising €9M in a seed round that will allow them to host a tasting of its first prototype of lab-grown pork by summer 2020.</p>

<p>As well as investment progress and huge technological leaps, there has also been strides made on the regulatory front. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food <span class="amp">&</span> Drug Administration (FDA) agreed to a joint regulatory framework, providing cell-based meat with a much clearer path to market in the United States.</p>

<p>A more recent bill, the Food Safety Modernization for Innovative Technologies Act, looks to formalize the agreement between FDA and USDA to jointly regulate cell-based meat products.</p>

<p>This space is growing at an ever increasingly fast rate, yet there are still real issues stunting its success, including scaling up production and making products affordable for mass markets. And with an ever-evolving regulatory landscape, it’s difficult to keep up to date on what is happening in the field.</p>

<p>Join this Summit to find the answers on your questions from scale up to food safety to labeling and more!</p>
