The funds raised will be used to provide an alternative protein that is neutral-tasting, functional, highly sustainable and affordable to the mainstream food industry. The round was led by NevaTeam Partners and supported by the European Union’s EIC Fund, as well as other leading food and climate funds and strategic partners from within the food industry. </p>
<p>Brevel's technology is the first in the world to combine sugar-based fermentation of microalgae with high light concentrations at industrial scales to produce a protein that will be incorporated by food manufacturers into plant-based products. This technological breakthrough tackles the primary barriers to market penetration for new protein sources: <strong>taste, functionality, and cost</strong>, creating the most suitable protein for the plant-based industry. As a result, Brevel’s proteins are increasingly in demand by food manufacturers for a wide variety of applications, and will enable the development of healthier, tastier and environmentally friendly non-animal food products.</p>
<p>The company is primarily targeting the dairy alternative sector, which faces a significant challenge in protein content. Other plant-based protein sources such as soy are allergenic and often have overpowering flavors, making them less efficient for use in plant-based milk and cheese products. In contrast, Brevel's protein can be seamlessly incorporated, significantly boosting nutritional value and enhancing texture without compromising on taste, color, or cost.</p>
<p>Brevel is achieving cost parity with traditional plant-based protein sources such as pea and soy by utilizing its unique technology to generate valuable co-products alongside the high concentration of functional protein from microalgae such as functional lipids, pigments and more. This approach enables Brevel to attain almost triple the profitability from the same microalgae, making it feasible to price the protein competitively in the market.</p>
<p>Brevel’s process causes the smallest environmental footprint possible and is unaffected by weather conditions, climate change and seasonal variations. It does not require arable land, can recycle 100% of the water, use on-site clean energy and feed the world with a fraction of the land used today for traditional agriculture. Brevel has been operating their large-scale 500 liter pilot in Israel and will very soon move into their first of commercial-scale factory with the first-of-its-kind 5000 liter fermentation and light system. All of Brevel’s manufacturing systems have been designed and built by Brevel, as well as the development of all the biological processes.</p>
<p>“This substantial funding round will fuel Brevel’s journey forward and pave the way for our vision of sustainable nutrition for the future of our planet to materialize,” says Yonatan Golan, CEO and Co-Founder of Brevel. “We are primed and ready for our next major leap – the global scale production of Brevel's protein that will be integrated into healthier, tastier and environmentally-friendly food products in every household”.</p>
<p>“Having followed Brevel’s impressive developments and achievements in recent years, we believe that Brevel will be one of the leading companies in the global alternative protein industry and we are excited to join their journey towards that goal,"" Said Shai Levy, Managing Partner at NevaTeam Partners, who will also be joining Brevel’s board. “We believe that Brevel’s innovative technology enables the cost-efficient production of high-quality protein extracted from microalgae, which is crucial for the future of sustainable food production.”</p>
<p>“We identified Brevel as an ambitious company with breakthrough technology which can provide significant impact. After the Horizon 2020 non-dilutive grant, the EIC Fund made the decision to further support and join Brevel with an equity investment in their<strong> </strong>journey towards a sustainable future.” says Svetoslava Georgieva, Chair of the EIC Fund Board.</p>
<p>Brevel's seed funding totals $18.5M, including $8.4M converted from grants and convertible loans into shares.</p>
<p><strong>About Brevel</strong></p>

<p>BioCraft’s proprietary cultured chicken offers all essential nutrients cats and dogs need, without chemical and bacterial contaminants, antibiotics, steroids or other hormones such as can be found in traditional meat. Derived from stem cells, BioCraft’s chicken is neither genetically modified nor immortalized. While it is common to license cell lines from third-party providers, BioCraft’s cell lines are wholly owned by the company, with the chicken stem cell line being derived by BioCraft’s in-house stem cell scientist and veterinarian Rupal Tewari, MSc, PhD, DVM.</p>
<p>Although chicken is among the top allergens for both cats and dogs, it is still one of the most commonly used ingredients in pet food. As such, BioCraft has developed the chicken cell line to meet the demand of pet food manufacturer partners, and consumers, for conventional species.</p>
<p>“While cultured mouse meat—the ancestral diet of the cat—remains our primary focus for cat food, the new chicken cell line for cats or dogs is ideal for pet food manufacturers and ultimately pet parents who lean toward more traditional meat ingredients,” said BioCraft founder and CEO Dr. Shannon Falconer. “Dr. Tewari’s rare combination of expertise in stem cell and veterinary science are unique in the industry, and give us an advantage over every other cultured meat company.”</p>
<p>BioCraft is working directly with pet food manufacturers interested in transitioning their conventional meat ingredients to supply-chain stable, sustainable, safe, humane cultured meat. BioCrafted meat offers pet food companies a more uniform raw material that is significantly less likely to carry any pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli, and other common fecal-borne bacteria that lead to costly recalls.</p>
<p>BioCraft’s chicken is created with the consistency of the “meat slurry” used in conventional pet food manufacturing, and can be used as a one-to-one replacement in wet or dry foods, treats, and fresh pet foods. BioCrafted meats are nutritionally robust, with all required protein, key vitamins, fats and amino acids such as taurine—a nutrient typically lost during high-heat processing during the rendering process of conventional meat, then added back in synthetic form for nutritionally complete pet foods.</p>
<p>BioCrafted meat grows in a controlled and pathogen-free environment surrounded by a liquid medium of vitamins and minerals formulated without fetal bovine serum (FBS), a process ingredient inhumanely obtained from the slaughter of pregnant cows that has been commonly used to produce other cultured meats.</p>
<p>Conventional meat production—for pets and people—has devastating consequences, including climate change, animal cruelty and risks to public health. Animals are fed diets laden with antibiotics, a primary contributor to antibiotic resistance in humans and pets, and hormonal steroids to accelerate their growth. The intensive confinement of animals to slaughter for meat is contributing to air and water pollution, deforestation, desertification and ocean dead zones, while also promoting deadly outbreaks and zoonotic diseases. More than 25 percent of the environmental impact of animal agriculture is attributed to feeding pets in the U.S. alone: if cats and dogs occupied their own country, they would be the world’s fifth largest meat-consuming nation.  </p>
<p><strong>About BioCraft</strong><br />
BioCraft Pet Nutrition, founded in 2016, is the first and only biotech company to create meat-based pet food that doesn’t come at the expense of slaughtering other animals. BioCraft was also the first to create a proprietary growth medium as an alternative to fetal bovine serum (FBS), helping reduce production costs by well over an order of magnitude and representing a key step towards commercial scale. Today, the BioCraft team includes a roster of PhD scientists, a veterinarian, and serial entrepreneurs, all focused on taking animals out of the supply chain by producing the healthiest, most environmentally sustainable and supply-chain stable meat for dogs and cats. BioCraft is located in both North America and Europe, with R&amp;D performed via its subsidiary company, BioCraft Pet Nutrition GmbH in Austria. BioCraft investors include Draper Associates, SOSV, KEEN Growth Capital, Orkla Food Ingredients, Sentient Investment, Hack Capital and angel investors.

<li>CellX has successfully completed the development of more than ten cell lines from various species, a few of which have been adapted to grow in suspension in serum free media, and the leading cell line has entered the pilot stage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shanghai, June 25, 2023</strong> — Chinese leading cellular agriculture company CellX raised $6.5M in its Series A+ funding. This new round is led by multiple strategic investors, and it will aid CellX's move towards pilot scale production of its cultivated meat products. To date, CellX has raised over $20M in total, making it China's most funded cellular agriculture startup.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, CellX has built R&amp;D platforms across the four major technological pillars of cultivated meat, cell line development, media optimization, novel bioprocess design, and end product innovation. Earlier this year, CellX announced its plan to build China's first cultivated meat pilot production facility, hosting multiple thousand-liter bioreactors.</p>
<p>""We have successfully developed 10+ cell lines from various species, adapted 5+ of them into suspension culturing, and the leading cell line has now entered pilot stage."" said Dr. Chen, Director of R&amp;D at CellX. ""Besides, we have also developed multiple serum free media and improved the yield significantly, enabling us to drastically reduce the production cost. We are currently working on scaling up to 2,000L.""</p>
<p>It is reported that the pilot production facility is jointly built by CellX and Tofflon, a listed biotech and food equipment company. Besides hosting multiple thousand liter bioreactors, the facility will also provide an interactive space for consumers to taste CellX’s demo products. This facility will be China's first ""transparent food space"" for cultivated meat R&amp;D, pilot production, and public tasting.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziliang Yang, cofounder and CEO of CellX, shared the company's strategic plans for the future:</p>
<p>""Meat is a commodity that needs to be consistently produced at a competitive cost and large scale. Each year, China alone consumes 100+ million tons of meat, more than a quarter of global meat consumption. For cultivated meat to have a meaningful impact on our global food supply chain, production at low cost and at scale is key.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no company in our space has fully cracked the puzzle of production at low cost and scale, yet. This is where CellX and China can add value. Thanks to China's booming biopharma industry and fermentation sector, there is already a good ecosystem in place, including media and equipment at competitive pricing, as well as a large pool of talented bioprocess engineers. All of which enables companies to produce cultivated meat at a significantly lower cost in China.""</p>
<p>Despite the recent trend of decoupling between China and the west, Ziliang still believes in the prospect of globalization in the field of cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>""At the end of the day, carbon and sustainability are global issues that humanity faces together. It's one of the few areas where there is common understanding.""</p>
<p>Due to its significance in carbon reduction and food security, cultivated meat has been increasingly put under the spotlight in China. In early 2022, cultivated meat and ""future foods"" were included in China's 14th 5-Year plan by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, for the very first time. During his speech to the annual session of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, President Xi also said that China must adopt “a ‘Greater Food’ approach” to nutrition, to ensure a secure supply of all staple food groups.</p>
<p>""The facility is almost ready, and we are about to start the first batch of 2,000L run."" Ziliang says. ""We will be opening our doors for public tasting soon, and we are excited to invite you to Shanghai for a taste of the future.""</p>

<p><a href=""https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/"">Cultivated meat</a> is meat grown directly from animal cells without the need to raise animals. Roslin Technologies was spun out from the University of Edinburgh’s <a href=""https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin"">Roslin Institute</a>, the place where <a href=""https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/about/dolly"">Dolly the Sheep</a>, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, was born in the nineties. Now, more than 25 years later, Roslin Technologies is leading the field of developing<a href=""https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/deep-dive-cultivated-meat-cell-lines/""> pluripotent animal stem cells </a>which have the capacity to self-renew indefinitely and differentiate into desired end-tissues for the cultivated meat industry such as fat and muscle cells. Roslin Technologies is making these cells available to cultivated meat producers globally and the Company currently has customers in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>Kickstart Ventures is a leading venture capital firm from the Philippines, backed by <a href=""https://ayala.com/"">Ayala Corporation</a>, the oldest and one of the largest conglomerates in the country. The firm has a track record in investing in companies that help resolve systemic issues in supply chains that impact the Philippines and beyond. It sees increasing food prices, a growing global protein gap and the resulting risks around food insecurity as a key challenge to the Philippines. The promise of cultivated meat for shorter supply chains, reduced production time, and comparable nutrition to conventional meat, make cultivated meat a compelling and scalable opportunity.</p>
<p>The strategic investment from Kickstart Ventures strengthens the Company’s footprint in Asia. It also expands Roslin Technologies’ international shareholder base which already includes investors from the UK, Europe, Asia and US demonstrating the global potential of Roslin Technologies’ offering.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernst-van-orsouw-25989912/"">Ernst van Orsouw</a>, Roslin Technologies’ CEO, says:</p>
<p><em>“We are very excited about working with Kickstart. They are passionate about the company and bring a great footprint in Asia that will help us expand in that region.”</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/minettenavarrete/"">Minette Navarrete</a>, President and Co-Founder of Kickstart Ventures adds:</p>
<p><em>""This investment in Roslin Tech is a milestone for Kickstart and the ACTIVE Fund. The <a href=""https://kickstart.ph/investment-focus"">ACTIVE Fund’</a>s investment in Roslin Tech feeds into our thesis of A World of Plenty, which invests in the future of resource availability - particularly in innovative technologies that reframe the scarcity and abundance of resources.</em></p>
<p><em>This investment is meaningful for the future of food security globally, especially in emerging markets like the Philippines. The persistent and complex issue of food insecurity demands multiple transformative solutions. The world's capacity to feed a growing population is limited.</em></p>
<p><em>Roslin Tech offers a solution that augments this limited capacity at scale, and with speed. Roslin Tech, with their scalable, IP-rich approach and innovative technology, offers a compelling and commercially attractive solution. Together, we strive to create a sustainable future for food and alleviate hunger and food insecurity.”</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/natalieblackuk"">Natalie Black,</a> His Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific said:</p>
<p><em>“Kickstart Ventures’ investment into Roslin Technologies highlights the strengths of the UK’s world-class $1 trillion tech sector, third in the world after the US and China.

<p>Powered by Co-Founders and industry angel investors, Arman Anatürk, Camille Bossell and Emilie Dellecker, HackCapital enables Founders, Fund Managers, and Syndicates across ClimateTech to easily raise capital from their networks for their own raises.</p>
<p>30+ startups and funds have been enabled to pool capital into their round and tap into HackCapital’s investor network including Austria-based Arkeon turning CO2 into functional, climate positive ingredients, US-based Tandem Repeat creating a new generation of self-healing biomaterials, and Israeli Bioraptor, a picks and shovel startup leveraging AI to supercharge deeptech startups.</p>
<p>“HackCapital was created to address the biggest need of our community; mobilising capital towards private companies and funds active in the impact sector. We see ourselves as the enabler of the ecosystem, being the financial platform behind the best founders and fund managers to help them do more of what they do best,” explains Arman Anatürk, CEO and Co-Founder of HackCapital.</p>
<p>With the UN estimating that <a href=""https://www.unepfi.org/positive-impact-2/#:~:text=An%20estimated%20%245%2D7%20trillion,address%20the%20SDGs%20financing%20gap."">$5-7 trillion</a> is needed per year between 2015 and 2030 to achieve a set of SDGs globally, HackCapital helps to bridge the funding gap by opening up a new route of financing from small ticket accredited investors and removing the traditional complexities associated with fundraising from multiple investors across geographies.</p>
<p>Its current capabilities cover roll-up vehicles for founders raising their next round, feeder funds for managers raising their next venture fund and micro vehicles for first time asset managers looking to quickly setup and deploy. These three solutions use automation and digitisation to speed up, and reduce the cost, to raise and deploy meaningful capital for builders and capital allocators working across sustainability and health.</p>
<p>A recurring theme amongst the investments structured on HackCapital is that they’re all made alongside “industry leading venture firms” such as US-based Siddhi Capital and Germany’s FoodLabs - who were also early investors in the company’s pre-seed round last year.</p>
<p>When asked why they decided to build HackCapital, Co-Founder Emilie responded “Truth is, we built HackCapital for ourselves first. We saw so many great companies come through our doors and present their early visions at our <a href=""https://www.hacksummit.co"">HackSummit</a> events and <a href=""https://foodhack.global/events/meetups"">Meetups</a> which have gone on to become some of the biggest successes in our industry. I wish back then I had the means and the knowledge to write the first checks to these founders - and I’m sure others in our community would have done so too”.</p>
<p>Unlike similar investment tools that structure SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) and which have a limitation on the number of investors, HackCapital has built a novel EU-based structure that replaces the need for SPVs altogether, significantly reducing the time and cost to pool capital, and without limitation on the number of investors that can take part.</p>
<p>Camille Bossel, Co-Founder of HackCapital, expressed the significance of establishing a robust legal framework that surpasses industry standards. “The primary objective was to create a structuring platform that offers unparalleled flexibility without compromising security. After careful consideration, Luxembourg was chosen as the ideal location for setting up our investment platform. Luxembourg stands as the second leading fund administration hub globally, following Delaware, and boasts a digital-friendly environment. Moreover, its securitisation regulation we operate under has the potential to revolutionise access to private market impact investments.”</p>

<p>VIENNA, Austria – May 23, 2023 – Because Animals, the first biotech company to develop cultured meat for the pet food market, announced today it has rebranded the company as <a href=""https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=7-2Fu-2BFt8h-2F-2B8IbrV7wG96TO3cmrcgK2OkhgI1G9SLQvk-3Df3z8_tMV4yW93kyq5xPNHdnwLP1f9RG297xY9o1sswaOmKAl76jEnjDLFJzSm4Di45-2BxPkMNvYpWvniKFROx71PZWzGKu2xuPfIpAp-2BNzG8iQf76C-2FXbE0T63q8XyQ8dbgJOgsNtEXtbixfrYe1m2bWVd031PFiWbN2TAjr2wjLCBJ6C9WtK8898rExyUDczCIPpM00gYcj28VVKgq371mOeLNPP7OFnhp-2BBlBOyefAG05toExUW2XaJWOeqSyT3nWcStd-2FF3I0oIAnCQUxY-2Bg3vAN4Qu8GFqc0upbd1CXPBJWLm13hOzG54Iq4wGHTE6zJ8j708w-2FxNcKXf87mGa3T2SeSLoG5kfymGy0mZbozNfNWA-3D"">BioCraft Pet Nutrition</a> as it shifts to working directly with pet food manufacturers interested in supply-chain stable, high-quality, sustainable, safe, humane cultured meat.</p>
<p>The name change follows BioCraft’s decision to dedicate its resources solely to the commercialization of cultured meat including R&amp;D, infrastructure, and collaborative relationships. In late 2022, the company discontinued its plant-based products marketed under the Because Animals brand, divesting from those formulations and provisional patents, while retaining all intellectual property relating to cultured meat.</p>
<p>BioCraft is building partnerships with leading pet food manufacturers interested in adding cultured meat to their product lines. BioCrafted meat offers pet food companies a more uniform raw material that is significantly less likely to carry any pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli, and other common fecal-borne bacteria that lead to costly recalls.</p>
<p>To accelerate product development, BioCraft has appointed Dr. Theresa Rothenbücher its chief product officer. Rothenbücher is the cofounder and former chief scientific officer of Revo Foods, an innovator in high-precision 3D food-printing technology, and holds a doctorate in molecular biology/tissue engineering and an MSc in molecular and applied biotechnology. Her background in stem cell-based tissue engineering and food technology innovation, and experience as an entrepreneur introducing products to the European market, boosts BioCraft’s technical and commercial reach.</p>
<p>“As we intensified our focus on developing cultured meat for pet food manufacturers, and built up our scientific efforts, it was appropriate to claim a new identity that signals the state of the art in pet nutrition,” said BioCraft founder and CEO Dr. Shannon Falconer. “Bringing in Theresa’s experience in tissue engineering and product development multiplies our strengths, and puts us on the path to becoming the leading provider of cultured meat for the pet food supply chain.” </p>
<p>Rothenbücher joins Dr. Chai Molina, chief computational officer, who has led BioCraft’s mathematical modeling and AI initiatives since joining the company in 2022. Molina holds a PhD in Mathematics, and an MSc in theoretical and mathematical biology. His doctoral work in mathematical modeling of biological systems was recognized with a prestigious award by the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society, and he subsequently worked as a postdoctoral scholar at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria.</p>
<p>BioCraft’s team also includes COO Jonny Cruz, a veteran of the pet food industry with more than ten years of experience in sales, marketing, operations, distribution, and supply chain systems. In addition to working for large pet food brands, he cofounded and served as CEO of All Things Pet, an industry sales and marketing consultancy representing 14 brands including multinationals.</p>
<p>BioCraft’s meat contains no chemical and bacterial contaminants, antibiotics, pentobarbital (a euthanizing drug), steroids, or other hormones, and is not produced using genetic engineering/GMOs. BioCrafted meats are nutritionally robust, with all required protein, key vitamins, fats and amino acids such as taurine—a nutrient typically lost during high-heat processing of meat slurry, then added back in synthetic form for nutritionally complete pet foods.</p>
<p>BioCraft grows meat from proprietary cell lines in a controlled and pathogen-free environment surrounded by a liquid medium of vitamins and minerals formulated without fetal bovine serum (FBS), a process ingredient inhumanely obtained from the slaughter of pregnant cows that has been commonly used to produce other cell-based meats.</p>
<p>BioCraft’s cultured meat is formulated with a similar consistency as the “meat slurry” used in conventional pet food manufacturing, so it can be used as a one-to-one replacement in wet or dry foods, treats, and fresh pet foods.</p>
<p>Conventional meat production—for pets and people—has devastating consequences, including climate change, animal cruelty and risks to public health. Animals are fed diets laden with antibiotics, a primary contributor to antibiotic resistance in humans and pets, and hormonal steroids to accelerate their growth. The intensive confinement of animals to slaughter for meat is contributing to air and water pollution, deforestation, desertification and ocean dead zones, while also promoting deadly outbreaks and zoonotic diseases. More than 25 percent of the environmental impact of animal agriculture is attributed to feeding pets in the U.S. alone: if cats and dogs occupied their own country, they would be the world’s fifth largest meat-consuming nation.</p>
<p><strong>About BioCraft</strong><br />
BioCraft Pet Nutrition, founded in 2016, is the first and only biotech company to create meat-based pet food that doesn’t come at the expense of slaughtering other animals. In 2021, BioCraft introduced the first cultured meat product for the pet trade—cat treats made from mouse cells—a milestone for the company and the entire industry. BioCraft was also the first to create a proprietary growth medium as an alternative to fetal bovine serum (FBS), helping reduce production costs by well over an order of magnitude and representing a key step towards commercial scale. Today, the BioCraft team includes a roster of PhD scientists, a veterinarian, and serial entrepreneurs, all focused on taking animals out of the supply chain by producing the healthiest, most environmentally sustainable and supply-chain stable meat for dogs and cats. BioCraft is located in both North America and Europe, with R&amp;D performed via its subsidiary company, BioCraft Pet Nutrition GmbH in Austria. BioCraft investors include Draper Associates, SOSV, KEEN Growth Capital, Orkla Food Ingredients, Sentient Investment, Hack Capital and angel investors. BioCraft Pet Nutrition GmbH is a recipient of grant funding from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG).

<p>One of the most prohibitive expenses in scaling up cultivated meat production is developing non-animal-derived serum protein mimetics that promote and support cell growth. Such proteins are not widely available in the current market at the quantity, quality and cost necessary for large-scale production. Aleph Farms turned to Enzymit to co-develop novel insulin substituents in microorganisms that can fulfill the function of proteins found naturally in animals and do so with greater desired activity per molecule.</p>
<p>""Developing more suitable processing aids for the production of cultivated meat is imperative for driving economies of scale and taking cultivated meat mainstream,” said Neta Lavon, PhD, CTO of Aleph Farms. ""This innovation, combining Enzymit’s outstanding protein design and experimental capabilities with our team’s expertise in cellular agriculture, is helping to build the foundations for our sector to achieve cost-efficiency and long-term impact.”</p>
<p>The success of this collaboration opens the door to additional benefits, far beyond the cultivation of cow cells. As insulin is a highly conserved protein across mammals and other species, it has the potential to similarly influence the production of other cultivated meat types, such as porcine, ovine and poultry.</p>
<p>“Aleph Farms has been an invaluable partner for this initiative, which can pave the way for more cost-efficient production of cultivated meat,” said Gideon Lapidoth, PhD, CEO of Enzymit. “With recombinant proteins currently accounting for the overwhelming majority of cell culture costs, creating highly stable and more active insulin substituents can markedly reduce the cost of growth media and increase efficiency in producing cultivated meat at scale.”</p>
<p>Utilizing its proprietary computational design algorithms and high-throughput testing capabilities, Enzymit was able to quickly develop a variety of insulin substituents and experimentally assess their functionality. All those selected were soluble proteins expressed in <em>E. coli</em> and purified without requiring refolding, complex purification steps, or other treatments. Further screening resulted in several leading candidates exhibiting superior results in activity for cell culturing and requiring minimal concentration for activation. These new proteins, which demand notably fewer downstream purification and maturation processes, dramatically reduce production time and costs.</p>",11315

Developed through conducting scientific diligence into scores of cultivated meat companies over the years, the firm’s <em>Cultivated Meat Scientific Benchmarks</em> white paper covers the technical milestones and competencies Lever VC expects cultivated meat startups to have achieved by each fundraising stage, based on industry-standard progress rates. The benchmarks were developed by Lever VC’s scientific and technical team to assess the technical credibility and potential of startups with limited proof of concept.</p>
<p>Venture-backed sectors across the technology spectrum have faced public scandals in which celebrated startups were revealed to not have the technological capabilities investors believed them to have, with such “vaporware” incidents shaking confidence in their respective sectors. Recent media stories have highlighted similar risks and fears of a Theranos-style outcome in the cultivated meat sector. While thorough investor diligence is critical for preventing such situations, evaluating cultivated meat and dairy startups can prove challenging for those with limited technical expertise in this complex and nascent industry.</p>
<p>""We use these benchmarks to more quantitatively evaluate cultivated meat companies and identify areas where they lack progress or where certain metrics may be overly optimistic and require additional claim-vetting,"" said Jonathan Avesar, Lever VC's lead scientific advisor.</p>
<p>""We supplement our overall scientific analysis with these quantitative benchmarks that allow us to compare progress between companies, which aids in our evaluation of the risk/reward profile,” said Jonathan Avesar, Lever VC's lead scientific advisor. “The benchmarks also serve toward understanding if certain metrics may be overly optimistic and require additional claim vetting.""</p>
<p>“Especially for very early-stage companies, where cell mass quantities are extremely low and access to analytical tools is limited, rigorous scientific diligence is essential to validate a viable investment opportunity,” added Lever VC scientific associate Jasmin Kern. “It is especially important to scrutinize any assumptions made by start-ups and to verify the sources they are based on since they play a key role in the projections and models that inform decision-making.”</p>
<p>Lever VC, which is currently raising a $250 million Fund II, released its internal benchmarks in the hopes that publicly sharing its own standards would help investors that do not have internal scientific and technical expertise on the cultivated meat category better validate the claims and progress of startups in the sector.</p>

<p>Microcarriers are a crucial component in the production of cultured meat, a process that involves growing animal cells in bioreactors to produce animal meat without the need for animal slaughter. However, the current microcarriers used mostly in the pharma industry are synthetic and inedible, therefore not suitable for cultured meat production. The market faces also several other challenges, including high cost, poor scalability, and low cell attachment and proliferation rates.</p>
<p>Gelatex's nanofibrous scaffolds and microcarriers provide a solution to these challenges, with a 90% cost reduction and better cell migration and adhesion properties. Gelatex's microcarriers are highly porous, edible (GRAS ingredients), and animal-free, making them ideal for hybrid or fully cell-cultured meat. They are also validated for cell adhesion, proliferation, and stability, suitable for muscle, connective, and adipose tissue, and non-degradable versions are suitable for cellular agriculture suspended bioreactors. Various cell lines, including pork, poultry, beef, fish, mollusks, and other cell lines, have been successfully cultured in Gelatex's microcarriers and scaffolds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gelatex's patented halospinning technology creates a 3D structure that imitates the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) better than alternative solutions, leading to a cell adhesion rate that on average is more than 80%, and reducing overall production costs.</p>
<p>The application of microcarriers is not limited to cultured meat. Microcarriers are also used in the production of vaccines, and regenerative medicine, as well as in drug discovery and screening. Gelatex's microcarriers have the potential to disrupt these industries by providing a more efficient, cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional microcarrier solutions.</p>
<p>""With this grant, we aim to finalize our microcarrier recipes and optimize production technologies,"" said Märt-Erik Martens, CEO of Gelatex Technologies. ""We are thrilled to receive this grant from the Estonian Business and Innovation Agency to further our work in developing highly efficient microcarriers and microcarrier production technologies for industrial cellular agriculture and cultured meat. Our nanofibrous scaffolds and microcarriers provide better cell migration and adhesion properties for cultured meat, wound care, and drug development companies, turning industrial tissue engineering and cell culture into a reality.""</p>
<p>Gelatex Technologies has already received support from notable investors such as Techstars, Change Ventures, Crosslight Partners, Lifely VC, Climate Capital, Juha Rantala, and Christian Stiebner. The company is also raising additional funding to enter from piloting and R&amp;D to the commercial phase and set up an ISO-certified production facility.</p>
<p><em>Gelatex Technologies is an experienced materials technology company from Estonia and the inventor of cost-effective technology for nanofiber production called halospinning. Their scalable platform technology enables the implementation of nanofibers in applications that were inapproachable until now such as scaffolds for cell-cultured meat, scar-reducing wound care materials, bio-based filtration materials, and more. Gelatex was founded in 2016 and has raised €2.5M in dilutive and non-dilutive funding.</em></p>",11314

<p><strong>Netherlands – April 19, 2023</strong> – An ultra-sustainable new protein source made its debut at a meeting of European agrifood industry leaders and researchers in Turin, Italy on Wednesday, April 12, 2023. During the biannual gathering of partners in the EU-funded <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/plenitudeeu/"">Plenitude project</a>, consortium members were served mycoprotein-based “chicken style” filets, produced using bioprocess technology developed to address modern challenges of global protein sustainability. The tasting marks a key milestone toward the ingredient’s upcoming launch in European markets.</p>
<p>Mycoprotein is a highly nutritious food derived from fungi. While mycoprotein-based foods have been available for decades, food ingredient company ENOUGH led the Plenitude project’s development of a new technology that enables minimal-waste production by utilizing renewable feedstock and upcycling its byproducts in a circular fermentation bioprocess. The result is ABUNDA—a B2B mycoprotein ingredient food manufacturers can use to create a broad range of clean label, nutritious, delicious food products.</p>
<p>“Achieving a new level of sustainable and scalable mycoprotein production was only half the battle. We also needed to ensure ABUNDA’s culinary performance and sensory attributes are best in class while making it affordable for consumers,” said Craig Johnston, cofounder and director of strategic partnerships at Enough. “We completed the construction of the flagship plant and are ready for scalable production. The results of today’s tasting, alongside the incredible products of our project partners, show we are truly entering a new era for protein-rich foods.” </p>
<p>The Turin meeting menu additionally featured dishes from global agrifood giants, flavor and fragrance specialists, and leading plant-based food companies, also partners in the Plenitude project committed to developing new-generation meat substitutes using ABUNDA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global meat company ABP – No Pork Pieces</li>
<li>Plant-based meat company Vivera – Shawarma Kebab</li>
<li>Flavor and fragrance company IFF – “Beef” Rendang</li>
<li>Global agrifood giant Cargill – Plant-based Burger</li>
</ul>
<p>All menu items were prepared and served by <a href=""https://www.vanverburger.it/"">Van Ver Burger</a>, a traveling Italian food truck specializing in sustainable gastronomy.</p>
<p>“ABUNDA is one of the best plant-based chickens we have tried so far. Its taste and texture are just like real chicken. We love its versatility in applications and we can’t wait to have it on our menu,” said Pasquale Digiglio and Daniele Paradisi, cofounders and chefs at Van Ver Burger.</p>
<p>“Getting feedback from highly skilled chefs and foodservice operators—as well as consumers—is critical for validating the product and ensuring it can have the impact the world needs,” commented Michael Kilkie, head of culinary at Enough. “We focus on making Abunda so easy to cook that there is not much learning curve for chefs.”</p>
<p><strong>The technology</strong></p>
<p>Unlike plant proteins, mycoprotein utilizes glucose as feedstock to grow fungal proteins in a fermentation process with strong nutritional and sensory profiles for meat substitutes. The Plenitude project’s core technology is centered around a novel integrated bioprocess for making mycoprotein. In Sas van Gent, Netherlands, the world’s first such facility has been built alongside a Cargill biorefinery producing bioethanol. The plant, operated by ENOUGH , utilizes on-site glucose production, then returns its waste streams back to the biorefinery where they become bioethanol.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>To assess the project’s sustainability, life cycle assessment consultancy <a href=""http://www.lcengineering.eu/"">Life Cycle Engineering</a> will be conducting detailed analyses of the technology’s resource usage and potential for improving the environmental footprint of modern protein production. Preliminary results suggest that Abunda has significantly lower environmental impact than animal proteins.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Hamburg, April 17th 2023</strong> – Agrifoodtech start-up <a href=""https://microharvest.com/"">MicroHarvest</a>, a leading biotech company on a mission to build the sustainable food system of tomorrow, has been named as winning innovator for its response to the challenge of ‘Building a net-zero food production system’ by a panel of expert judges at the prestigious 2023 BloombergNEF (BNEF) Pioneers awards.</p>
<p>With competition from almost 350 applications received by the BNEF, the Hamburg-and-Lisbon-based company proved its credentials amongst worldwide peers by offering a novel, scalable and competitive solution to tackling the challenge of building towards a net-zero economy. The company's development of technology able to harness the power of microorganisms to produce nutritious and sustainable protein was judged against three criteria: its potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability, its degree of technology innovation and novelty, and its likelihood of adoption and potential scalability. MicroHarvest’s highly efficient protein production process suitably impressed the judges, earning the company its place alongside a prestigious group of Pioneer awards alumni.</p>
<p>This proprietary technology – based on biomass fermentation – enables production at a speed and efficiency that far exceeds other existing approaches. The result is quality protein ingredients containing over 60% raw protein, that can be produced within 24 hours from input to output. Possible applications along the whole protein value chain are manifold, ranging from animal feed to direct application in food and pet food.</p>
<p>The company operates within the accelerating segment of fermentation-enabled alternative protein that attracted $3.69Bn investment in the last decade, with a 37% increase in Europe in 2022. Aside from the booming alternative protein market for human food, MicroHarvest ingredients will also serve a pet food market estimated to grow to over $130Bn by 2030 - and a $62Bn aquafeed market.</p>
<p><strong>Katelijne Bekers, MicroHarvest Co-Founder &amp; CEO</strong>, commented on the announcement: “To be awarded this prestigious Pioneers prize by the BNEF amongst such impressive competition is something that we’re extremely proud of. The MicroHarvest team have made significant progress in overcoming the challenges associated with scaling biotechnological processes. We’re developing technology that fuels the resilient food system of tomorrow producing the nutritious and sustainable protein ingredients that the world will need in a very near future. We have already successfully completed a production trial at scale within our first two years, which is an exceptional speed in the fermentation-enabled alternative protein space. Based on our results to date, we are confident that we can marry the sustainability and scale necessary to become a champion of future protein in the B2B ingredients industry.""</p>
<p><strong>Claire Curry, selection committee co-chair and global head of Technology, Industry &amp; Innovation research at BloombergNEF</strong>, stated: “The search for new climate-technology solutions has never been as urgent. Technologies under development now must scale by 2030 if they are to play a significant role in helping reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Over the past three cycles of the Pioneers competition, we have chosen to focus on innovation areas where there are particularly large decarbonization hurdles. My belief is that our 2023 winners have the technology edge, the talent and the right support systems to play a significant role in overcoming the hurdles in scaling green hydrogen, producing sustainable metals at scale and in decarbonizing our food production system. We have now had 141 Pioneers winners since 2010, many of which have played an essential role in the energy and climate transition since their win. I look forward to seeing our 2023 winners do the same in the next decade.”</p>

<p>Aqua will use the investment to equip its new facility, scale up production, bring products to market, add key talent, and expand its roster of restaurant and foodservice outlets for product introductions this year.</p>
<p>“We appreciate having mission-aligned partners that offer strong strategic value for the next phase of our growth, which will involve building up the business and brand,” said Anne Palermo, CEO of Aqua. “Being good stewards of investor capital is important to us, so along with hitting milestones earlier than expected, we are benefiting from government programs, academic resources, and other advantages to get to market quickly.”</p>
<p>Aqua’s primary value is its low cost of scaling and its path to price parity, thanks to proprietary fermentation methods that use relatively affordable inputs and equipment. The company recently acquired a food-grade facility that was already built out nearly to its requirements—which it estimates will save more than a million dollars in construction costs.</p>
<p>Aqua was recently accepted into the Illinois Office of Business Development’s EDGE program that provides tax incentives to growing companies, which will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>“The adage is true that early-stage funds heavily weight investment conviction in people, and less in technologies or products given the embryonic nature of companies at these stages, but Aqua already boasts strength across its team, product, and key partnerships already in place,” said Johnny Ream, Partner at Stray Dog Capital. “We are interested in backing founding teams leveraging unique technologies and approaches that drive a more sustainable future; the work Aqua is doing with alt-seafood has immense potential to drive both human and planetary benefits in a massive $100B+ global market.”</p>
<p>The global plant-based seafood market was valued at $42.1 million in 2021, and is <a href=""https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/plant-based-seafood-market-A17387"">projected to reach $1.3 billion</a> by 2031 with a CAGR of more than 42 percent as wild fish stocks are further depleted. In addition to depleted fish populations, commercial fishing practices result in damage to ecosystems, plastic waste, and “bycatch” of non-target species. As fish farming increases, so does habitat destruction, pollution and diseases spread to wild fish, and the industry’s reliance on antibiotics and wild-caught fish for feed.</p>
<p>Despite its health halo, fish contains microplastics, mercury, pesticides, antibiotics, dioxin and PCBs. High in cholesterol and saturated fats, seafood, in particular finfish, is a good source of foodborne illness caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.</p>
<p>Aqua is developing calamari, shrimp, scallops, and filets of tuna and whitefish with proprietary mycoprotein fermentation processes that do not use any animal inputs, genetic altering or modification. Unlike plant-based processed foods formulated with starches and protein isolates, Aqua’s alt-seafood retains its naturally occurring fiber, protein, and other micronutrients. The company also produces minced “seafood” fillings for applications such as dumplings, ravioli, and sushi rolls.</p>

Galdieria sulphuraria is an extremophile microalga species with blue pigment that can live in extreme conditions and could represent a resilient source of protein for the food and feed of the future.</p>
<p>“<em>This is the first time the nutritional profile of this species has been accurately quantified and understood</em>,” says Pedro Moñino Fernández, PhD student and lead researcher on the EU-funded ProFuture project. “<em>We are now closer to real applications of this interesting and unexploited microalga that could have a significant impact on how the world feeds itself.</em>” The research results represent a key milestone for ProFuture, a project that scales up microalgae production as a sustainable, protein-rich food and feed ingredient.</p>
<p>As an extremophile species Galdieria sulphuraria can live in extreme environments that are typically not conducive to life. Although the species has been studied for decades due to its resilience and adaptability, it had not been examined as a possible food source or produced at scale yet. ProFuture studied a strain growing in the hot springs in the Naples region of Italy, and found the following results:</p>
<p><strong>Nutritional profile: Great potential as an alternative protein source</strong></p>
<p>G. sulphuraria biomass was found to have protein content in the range of 62-65%, which is relatively high compared to other algal and fungal microorganisms with protein contents ranging from 30-70%. In addition, G. sulphuraria proteins have a good amino acid profile, including all essential amino acids. The proteins are especially rich in two amino acids rarely found in such high levels in non-animal-based proteins: cystine and methionine.</p>
<p><strong>A better source of blue pigment</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Microalgae offer some key advantages compared to other microorganisms currently being studied as potential food sources. They are a natural source of essential fatty acids, and species such as G. sulphuraria are among the few naturally occurring sources of blue pigment,</em>” says Iago Dominguez Teles, the project manager at Wageningen University.</p>
<p>G. sulphuraria contains a high concentration of a natural blue pigment commonly used as a colorant in cosmetics and food. This pigment has also been found to have antioxidant properties, as well as potential as a therapeutic agent. Compared to extractions of the already commercially produced microalgae strain Spirulina, the blue pigment extracted from G. sulphuraria demonstrates greater stability, increasing its potential in industrial applications. In addition, a mixotrophic production process is able to increase concentration of the blue pigment.</p>
<p><strong>A scalable production model: Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae</strong></p>
<p>The researchers developed an innovative production process using <a href=""https://www.pro-future.eu/news/industrial-mixotrophic-cultivation"">mixotrophy</a>—combining both photosynthesis and sugar-based feedstock to stimulate the growth of microalgae. To further validate the process beyond the bench scale, they could successfully demonstrate pilot production in a 1300-liter (1.5 cubic meter) bioreactor at Wageningen University.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps on the way to use G. sulphuraria in our foods</strong></p>
<p>In order to effectively exploit the promising results of G. sulphuraria, additional research is needed to assess its digestibility and to identify any additional processing methods that may be required for commercial applications. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently assessing the safety of Galdieria sulphuraria as a novel food for the general population and as a food supplement for adults. In addition, Blue Galdieria extract is assessed as a food additive.</p>
<p><strong>About ProFuture</strong></p>
<p>ProFuture is a four-year research project funded under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program, spanning from 2019 to 2023. The project’s aim is to scale microalgae production and prepare the market for uptake of microalgae proteins as ingredients for innovative and sustainable food and feed products. Bringing together 31 partners across academia and industry, ProFuture is coordinated by the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA) in Spain. The final conference of ProFuture will take place on 13th and 14th of September 2023 in Brussels, including hybrid participation. More information will be published on ProFuture channels soon.</p>

<p>A new initiative of Israel’s Modern Agriculture Foundation (MAF), the world’s first known non-profit dedicated to advancing the alternative protein industry, the celebratory event coincided with this month’s observance of International Women’s Day and was designed to bring the women, many of whom had not previously met, together as a cohesive community.</p>
<p>In a Ted-style talk on “Building a female-friendly foodtech ecosystem,” Dr. Tali Feldman Sivan, co-founder and active chairperson of Meala FoodTech, noted a variety of metrics indicating that Israeli foodtech companies enjoy higher female representation compared to Israeli high tech in general, including, for example, 2.5 times the number of women CEOs.</p>
<p>“There is something exceptional about Israeli foodtech,” noted Feldman Sivan, “and this is thanks to networking. But we don’t do it enough and we don’t include enough people. Men do it and it works it.”</p>
<p>“Building connections between experts with complementary knowledge and talents is at the very heart of MAF’s mission to accelerate the alternative proteins ecosystem,” said Levana Shifman, the head of MAF, who led the initiative. “For that reason, the awards evening is just a beginning, with many ongoing meetups, conversations and events to come.”</p>
<p>“Knowledge sharing and networking are the key to creating impact,” added Carole Bibas-Barkan, MAF’s COO, explaining the NGO’s motivation for organizing the event.</p>
<p>Another key to the advancement of women in the foodtech industry, is “firgun,” said Dr. Feldman Sivan, using a Hebrew term referring to celebrating another’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>“Firgun” was abundant at the Asian dinner party, hosted by Mika FoodArt in her stunning Jaffa home. “What a perfect evening full of terrific energy and firgun for the sisterhood,” confirmed Keren Or Dubinsky, founder of Instegg.</p>
<p>“It was an impossible task to choose,” Anat Ziv, head of innovation for Tnuva, said of her responsibilities as one of the 11 expert judges charged with selecting the dynamic group of female foodtech superstars out of an initial crowded pool of 50 candidates.</p>
<p>Addressing the participants, she added: “I’m tremendously excited about this opportunity to honor your critical contributions. It is essential to continue to draw more women into the field, and by building this stellar network, we can further that goal.”</p>
<p>“Each one of you is more impressive than the next,” agreed Shifman, addressing the diverse cohort with representation from companies, hubs and VCs including Aleph Farms, Sea2Cell, ChickP, Innovopro, Bee-io Honey Ltd., and Kinoko-Tech, The Kitchen Hub, Fresh Start and JVP, alongside independent researchers and consultants.</p>
<p>Co-sponsored by Tnuva Ventures, the venture capital fund belonging to Israel’s largest manufacturer of food products, along with Reinhold Cohn, Tivall, ConexionIsrael, VidiMoni and Midas Chocolate, the recognition for the 26 women drew a great deal of notice in Israel’s broader foodtech ecosystem, with many additional women requesting to participate in future events involving the emerging sisterhood of outstanding foodtech figures.</p>
<p>The next networking meeting for this impressive group is scheduled for late May.</p>

</ul>
<p>Rehovot, 20.03.2023: Israeli molecular farming company PoLoPo has closed  a $1.75m funding round to double down on developing its proprietary technology to grow animal proteins in potatoes - the world’s most widely grown non-cereal food crop. The Pre-seed round was led by FoodLabs, further investors include CPT Capital, Siddhi Capital, Plug and Play Ventures, Milk &amp; Honey Ventures and HackCapital. With the fresh funding, PoLoPo will further expand its core team of world-class scientists and accelerate their R&amp;D efforts in order to offer prototypes in the coming year and a half.</p>
<p>PoLoPo has developed a proprietary technology to express proteins in potatoes in a scalable, cost-effective way, in order to meet the food industries’ protein demands and to nourish the world’s growing population. The company is building a technology platform for protein production, starting out with Ovalbumin (protein of the egg white), targeting the $26.6 billion egg protein market as well as the growing demand for egg white protein alternatives from the industry. PoLoPo’s Ovalbumin will be identical to “real” egg Ovalbumin in terms of functionality, nutritional value, and protein sequence. </p>
<p>“We’re glad to have won a group of such renowned and like-minded investors”, said Dr. Maya Sapir-Mir. “With this substantial funding we are aiming to reach several significant milestones including protein rich potato tubers and Ovalbumin functional samples.”</p>
<p>“We want to produce better food for the world. Molecular farming technology, being harnessed for the production of high-quality proteins, presents a huge opportunity to do so, alongside with taking the animals out of the equation and reducing the carbon footprint of the production process” said Dr. Raya Liberman-Aloni </p>
<p>Produced in over 100 countries worldwide and the third most important food crop in the world, potatoes are an abundant, resilient, cheap, and versatile yet underused food source. PoLoPo’s potato-to-protein pathway commercial scalability since plants require relatively low investment to grow and are amenable to upscaling by common agricultural practice.</p>
<p>“We’ve been very impressed by the disruptive potential of their platform technology and, most importantly, by the deep plant science expertise of PoLoPo's founders and their bold vision for the company”, said Christian Guba, “We believe they are set to complement the incumbents in Precision Fermentation by pioneering a simpler approach to develop proteins.”</p>
<p>PoLoPo founders Dr. Maya Sapir-Mir and Dr. Raya Liberman-Aloni  are plant metabolic engineers, experts in expression and targeting of functional proteins in plants. The co-founders met over 15 years ago, during their PhD studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and worked side by side for 6 years.</p>
<p>PoLoPo has won the Coller startup competition FoodTech track, which took place in July 2022, thus securing its first investment from CPT Capital. </p>
<p>In October 2022, PoLoPo were crowned winners of the <a href=""https://foodhack.global/articles/meet-the-winners-of-the-foodhack-demo-day""><u>FoodHack Demo Day</u></a> as the startup with the most impact potential. </p>
<p><strong>About PoLoPo</strong></p>
<p>PoLoPo is a science based FoodTech startup using molecular farming technology that enables the production of real animal proteins without using any animals. PoLoPo is developing a plant to be used as a protein bio-factory.

The ingredient will be publicly showcased for the first time at San Francisco’s Future Food-Tech conference as part of a plant-based crispy chik’n karaage developed by <a href=""https://nourishventures.com/"">Nourish Ventures</a>, the corporate venture capital arm of <a href=""https://griffithfoods.com/"">Griffith Foods</a>. </p>
<p>OleoPro is a novel, plant protein-based fat ingredient for use in a range of alternative protein food products. Combining plant proteins and unsaturated plant-based oil, OleoPro is a high-performance, sustainable, and nutritious alternative fat ingredient. It enables a 90% reduction in saturated fat while enhancing technical performance in alternative meats when compared to commonly used, environmentally-taxing structured fats. OleoPro is self-standing, holding its shape at room temperature; browns when cooked; and delivers a juicy, fatty mouthfeel in plant-based meat applications. </p>
<p>“At Shiru, we think consumers shouldn’t have to compromise on taste or texture to make sustainable, nutritious food choices, and we know novel ingredients are crucial to unlocking the next generation of plant-based foods,” said Dr. Jasmin Hume, Shiru’s founder and CEO, “Oils commonly used in plant-based meats today like palm and coconut are disastrous for the environment and aren’t great from a health perspective either. OleoPro is a categorical upgrade, bringing all the juiciness and fattiness we expect from conventional meats to plant-based, but with a much improved nutritional profile and without tearing down the rainforest.”</p>
<p>OleoPro is patent-pending, and comes from Shiru’s proprietary technology platform, <a href=""https://www.shiru.com/approach/"">Flourish™</a>, which leverages AI to generate unique plant protein insights. Flourish uncovered highly functional proteins that, when combined with more sustainable oils through a novel process, create an ingredient that looks and behaves like traditional animal fat.</p>
<p>​​“We’re thrilled to be partnering with Shiru on the launch of their first ingredient, OleoPro. At Nourish Ventures, we understand food formulation, and recognize the historical challenges associated with delivering a true, fat-like experience for alternative proteins. OleoPro is a real game-changer, and we’re excited by its potential to impact the alternative protein industry,” said Simon Burton, managing director of Nourish Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Griffith Foods.</p>
<p>While initial development has focused on plant-based meat applications across multiple formats, Shiru is exploring additional applications, including plant-based dairy and personal care products. Shiru is currently sampling OleoPro to prioritize initial launch partners, with commercial production beginning later this year.

<p>From a broad pool of candidates including those well established in their field along with up-and-coming industry movers and shakers pioneering promising innovations, judges will select 12 women driving Israel’s success as a foodtech powerhouse. Tivall, a leading Israeli manufacturer of plant-based foods, has also signed on as a sponsor of the initiative.</p>
<p>“The recognition of these accomplished women embraces the fact that there are myriad routes to meaningful impact in foodtech, including research, development, entrepreneurship, investment, mentoring, policy, and more, all building a strong sector with the potential to address global challenges such as food security, climate crisis, supply chain issues, and health,” remarked Levana Shifman, who heads up the event on behalf of MAF. “Diversity engenders creative, outside-the-box solutions which characterize the StartUp Nation. We look forward to honoring women’s essential contributions in the exciting mosaic of Israel’s foodtech ecosystem.”</p>
<p>According to a 2022 report by the Israel Innovation Authority, women have comprised only one-third of Israel’s high-tech workforce for the last several years, a figure that declines at higher levels of the seniority scale. Compared to other global tech leaders, Israel has fewer female entrepreneurs, and their companies raise less funding. On the other hand, positive signs include increasing enrollment of Israeli women in relevant academic fields. Numerous leading foodtech companies in Israel were founded by women, including Aleph Farms, Sea2Cell, ProFuse Technology, and SavorEat.</p>
<p>Female-led companies comprised forty percent of MAF’s first cohort of the Better Plate alternative protein track within MassChallenge Israel’s Accelerator last year, including competition winner PoLoPo, co-founded by Raya Liberman-Aloni and Maya SapirMir, and Fabumin, with co-founder Adi Yehezkeli.</p>
<p>“For years, food companies failed to tap into the full potential of female leadership,” said MAF advisory board member Carmit Oron, CEO of SaliCrop, an Israeli startup developing innovative solutions to crop resiliency. “At the same time, female-led companies are at a major disadvantage when it comes to funding.”</p>
<p>In 2022, venture capital allocation for all-female leadership teams amounted to less than 2 percent of the $238.3 billion granted to American startups, representing a drop from 2.4 percent in 2021, according to PitchBook figures.</p>
<p>""I'm honored and proud to take part in this important initiative and represent Tnuva, which has championed the value of gender equality and diversity. Israel's foodtech ecosystem is blessed with talented women in various roles and positions. It's going to be a tough mission,” said Anat Ziv, Tnuva's head of corporate innovation, said of her judging responsibility. “International Women’s Day isn’t yet redundant. I look forward to advancing female leadership within the industry and I hope this undertaking will light the way and forge a path for other techs and industries to follow.”</p>
<p>Judges will convene in late February to select outstanding figures who will enjoy a festive and gourmet plant-based networking dinner to mark International Women’s Day featuring TED-style lectures and pitches.</p>
<p>Candidates may apply on their own behalf <a href=""https://www.modern-agriculture.org/open-call"">here</a> until Feb. 25, and others are also invited to use the link to nominate visionary individuals. In addition, opportunities are available for corporations, financial institutions, media outlets, and law firms to support the initiative as sponsors.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>February 2, 2023</strong> <strong>– Toronto, Ontario –</strong> Today, plant-based seafood producer <a href=""https://www.newschoolfoods.co/"">New School Foods</a> publicly announced its proprietary, scalable technologies for the plant-based meat industry, capable of producing whole-cut fish alternatives that look and cook just like ordinary seafood. The company also announced $12 million USD in seed funding from global investors including Lever VC, Blue Horizon, Hatch, Good Startup, Alwyn Capital, Joyance Partners, as well as grants from multiple agencies, including Protein Industry Canada.</p>
<p>For three years New School Foods CEO Christopher Bryson invested heavily in academic R&amp;D projects with some of the world’s leading Food Science Universities, and identified a scalable platform that delivers a number of firsts for the meat alternative industry:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Muscle fibers, made from plants: </strong>Replicates the diameter, length, strength and structure of fish muscle fibers to deliver the same texture &amp; mouthfeel.</li>
<li><strong>Whole-cut scaffolding: </strong>Filets that combines directionally aligned muscle fibers with plant-based connective tissue, fats, colors, and flavors.</li>
<li><strong>Raw-to-cooked: </strong>Unlike nearly all other products in the market that are pre-cooked by production, New School Foods’ cold-based processing technology creates a filet that starts raw and transforms like fish upon cooking.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable by design:</strong> Unlike many other new food processing technologies, New School Foods’ process uses off-the-shelf equipment from adjacent industries, providing a superior ability to scale more globally.</li>
</ol>
<p>The alternative protein market at large has yet to tackle the biggest opportunity: whole cuts, which represent a majority of meat sales in North America. Whole cuts come with a host of complex challenges like texture, connective tissue, muscle fibers, and other macrostructures that exist in animal proteins.</p>
<p>Whereas established production methods like high-moisture extrusion use high temperatures that pre-cooks the food and denatures the proteins, New School Foods’ technology uses a series of cold-based processes, yielding a product that is “raw” and transitions to cooked, keeping the cooking experience as close as possible to ordinary salmon.</p>
<p>“The next frontier of meat alternatives is whole cuts, and from day one we understood that New School Foods needed to solve two heavily connected issues: the quality of the meat alternatives in-market, and the limited toolkit our industry uses to produce them,” said Chris Bryson, CEO and founder of New School Foods. “What’s generally available for consumers now are rubbery, ground, pre-cooked products that will not convince the average customer to change their lifelong habits.”</p>
<p>New School Foods will continue focusing on research and development, using the $12 million raised in seed funding to expand the team of food scientists, scale up its scaffolding technology, and build out a research and production facility. </p>
<p>“We invested in New School Foods because they recognized that the existing production technologies in the plant-based meat industry are insufficient for creating a whole-cut product that consumers genuinely want to eat,” said Nick Cooney, general partner at Lever Ventures. “Their technology is unlike anything else we’ve seen in the industry in terms of truly mimicking the texture, mouthfeel, and experience of cooking and eating whole cuts of meat.”</p>
<p>New School Foods is also announcing the launch of a chef-only pilot program as they expect to launch their salmon alternative in numerous restaurants across North America in 2023. Chefs interested in joining can apply today at <a href=""http://newschoolfoods.co"">newschoolfoods.co</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About New School Foods</strong><br />
Founded in 2020 and based in Toronto, Canada, New School Foods Inc. develops whole-cut, plant-based seafood that emulates the same texture, taste, nutritional benefits and cooking experience of conventional seafood.</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., February 1, 2023 – Michroma, a leading precision fermentation food ingredient company, today announced it has closed $6.4 million in seed financing. The round will fast-track the company’s commercialization of sustainable natural colorants, expand research and development capabilities, and broaden Michroma’s ingredient platform. The company removes petroleum - the base ingredient in mainstream colorants - from the food ingredient value chain.</p>
<p>The $6.4m round was led by Supply Change Capital, a food tech VC backed by 301 INC, the corporate venture capital arm of General Mills. New investors include Be8 Ventures, which is backed by Dr. Oetker, a global food company based in over 40 countries; and CJ CheilJedang, a $23 billion Korean conglomerate that is the world's leading supplier of fermentation-based bio-products.</p>
<p>""We see compelling market and consumer potential for Michroma's fungal platform to create next-generation natural ingredients, from colorants to flavors, that are healthier and more sustainable while maximizing production efficiency.  We are excited by the speed and skill with which they are building out their capabilities. Even more so, in light of the current disruption of supply chains globally, we believe Michroma is laying the foundation for the sustainable ingredients of the future."" said Noramay Cadena, Supply Change Capital’s Managing Director and Michroma Board Member.</p>
<p>""We are poised to meet consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable food without petroleum-based ingredients,” said Michroma’s CEO and Co-founder, Ricky Cassini. “Unlike the current generation of unstable natural options, like betalains, carminic acid, and anthocyanins, Michroma is producing better-performing natural colorants powered by fungi. This next stage of our development will help us industrialize our fungal platform and enable the world’s transition to natural colors.”</p>
<p>Michroma’s novel approach centers on creating fungal biofactories to produce small molecules, like colors, more efficiently. “We are leveraging the power and versatility of filamentous fungi with our synbio platform. By combining a unique fungal chassis strain with precision fermentation, we are capable of producing high-value complex molecules with high yields previously unseen in the biotech industry,” said Michroma’s CSO and Co-Founder, Dr. Mauricio Braia.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019,  Michroma pioneered the movement toward a disruptive advance in the ingredients industry with high-performance colorants made from fungi using precision fermentation. Fueled by the increasing market demand for healthier and more sustainable ingredients, Michroma started by developing a novel red colorant called Red+, which is temperature-resistant and stable across the entire food pH spectrum. These characteristics allow colors to survive processes like pasteurization, cooking, and extrusion, which are among the most intensive processes for natural dyes. The company’s product pipeline starts with warm colors, which comprise 90% of the food market, and goes beyond to include other colors and novel flavors that will be sold in combination, allowing for integrated solutions for companies. </p>
<p>The $2.6B food colorants market continues to trend toward natural ingredients. According to a <a href=""https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2011/10/06/Nielsen-poll-indicates-global-preference-for-natural-food-colours""><u>poll</u></a>, 92% of people are concerned about artificial colors and large food manufacturers (BurgerKing, Nestle, Kraft, Mars, General Mills, etc.) are transitioning away from artificial colors to meet health-conscious consumers’ demand for natural ingredient alternatives. Leading research underscores the detrimental effects of artificial colorant consumption, with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) <a href=""https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/press-release/report-links-synthetic-food-dyes-hyperactivity-and-other""><u>concluding</u></a> in 2021 that artificial food dyes impact neurobehavior in some children. More recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received a <a href=""https://www.cspinet.org/resource/red-3-petition""><u>petition</u></a> from The Center for Science in the Public Interest and 23 other organizations and prominent scientists​​ to ban the use of Red No. 3 colorant in food.</p>
<p>New investors in Michroma include FEN Ventures, Boro Capital, The Mills Fabrica, Portfolia’s Food &amp; Ag Tech Fund, New Luna Ventures, Siddhi Capital, Groundswell Ventures, and HackCapital; and Angels investors Allen Miner, Jun Ueki and Steve Zurcher from the Keiretsu Japan Forum, Guillermo Rosental, Franco Goytia, Pablo Pla and Mat Travizano. Existing investors participating in the round are SOSV’s IndieBio and GRIDX.</p>
<p>Following prototyping with some of the world's largest food companies, Michroma is negotiating agreements for Red+ with ingredients suppliers for global distribution and will submit color additive petitions to the FDA and EFSA as the company continues its path to scale.</p>

This round marked the entry into the capital of impact investors - Noshaq, Newtree Impact, and Beyond Impact - and significant international groups of the food industry: Grupo Bimbo, Thai Union Group and more. These new resources allow Algama to carry out an ambitious industrial development plan, with the opening of a plant in Belgium, and to position itself as a critical player in the food industry's transition to using new proteins.</p>
<p>Raw materials have been under pressure for years - the egg market has been particularly volatile - the food industry is gradually turning to better environmental impact and innovative solutions. In this respect, the alternative represented by microalgae in daily food is an ideal resource at all levels: their production respects the environment, and their consequent nutritional contributions in proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fatty acids meet the expectations of consumers and therefore of agribusinesses.</p>
<p><strong>Algama, the pioneer in the use of microalgae in human food</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2013 and with operations in France, Belgium, and the United States, Algama has become a key player in using microalgae in human food. Thanks to unique processes for separating and formulating microalgae, Algama can offer customized alternative solutions free of the constraints usually associated with using microalgae. A sustainable and ethical solution, but also highly competitive because it is less expensive than its counterparts.</p>
<p><em>""Our patented seaweed processing allows us to produce high-quality, lowcost, environmentally friendly plant ingredients. The flavors stay true because Algama offers above all delicious products.""</em> - Alvyn Severien, cofounder and CEO of Algama</p>
<p>The solutions are widely proven and ready to be scaled up to position Algama as a global leader in this cutting-edge sector. Growth objectives were made possible by the confidence of historical shareholders, such as Beyond Impact, investors specialized in impact - Noshaq and Newtree Impact - and heavyweights of the food industry: Grupo Bimbo, and Thai Union Group.</p>
<p>Tamalga® a range of industrial ingredients replacing eggs validated by the market. The egg market - worth more than 200 billion euros worldwide - is under severe pressure due to increased raw materials, energy prices, and repeated avian flu outbreaks. As a result, prices have sometimes been multiplied by 6 in some regions of the world and many food industry players are facing shortages.</p>
<p>Algama brings together researchers, engineers, nutritionists, and chefs on an innovation platform of 40 people. The company offers expertise ranging from the selection of algae to the formulation of ingredients. Moreover, Algama accompanies its customers in the largescale industrialization of plant-based products in France and abroad by offering a customized service. The company's flagship product, Tamalga®, replaces eggs in many industrial applications, particularly in the bakery, pastry and confectionery industries (buns, cookies, puddings, madeleines, waffles, etc.).</p>
<p><em>""Algama's ingredients and products are totally disruptive: they actively participate in the reduction of the climate footprint of the food chain by replacing animal proteins with plant proteins, and they revolutionize the food industry at the taste, nutritional and functional levels. And exceptionally in this emerging sector, they are very competitive in terms of price, which promises them a very bright future.""</em> - Benoît de Bruyn, Founder and CEO of Newtree Impact</p>
<p>The potential is enormous; massive players in the baking market are using new plantbased or egg-substitute lines in their products that have already hit the shelves. New uses for texturizing and nutritionally enhancing products, such as meat or fish analogues, are also emerging.</p>
<p><strong>Opening of the first plant to meet the demand for biobased ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Holder of 25 patents in 31 countries, Algama is now ready to move up a gear by expanding its innovative solutions within an ambitious industrial plan to meet the strong market demand.</p>
<p><em>""By scaling up to a larger industrial scale, Algama can have a strong impact in the face of the global emergency and change the food industry system by democratizing algae in our daily diet.""</em> - Alvyn Severien</p>
<p>To meet this demand while remaining close to its strategic partners, Algama has chosen to set up its first factory on a 10,000 m2 industrial site located in Liege, Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>Key figures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Financing obtained: 13 million euros</li>
<li>Number of patents: 25</li>
<li>Number of employees: 40</li>

</ul>
<p>Jerusalem, Israel – The Hebrew University of Jerusalem announced today the publication of a groundbreaking study in the prestigious journal <a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00658-w__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8Fo1a5fJw$"">Nature Foods</a>, demonstrating a comprehensive cost efficient production method of cultured chicken.</p>
<p>In a study led by Professor Yaakov Nahmias, the Founder, President and Chief Technology Officer of <a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.believermeats.com/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8G2ZTxYzQ$"">Believer Meats</a>, researchers produced immortal cells lines of chicken fibroblasts using a process of spontaneous immortalization patented by the company last year. In contrast to others in the field, the process does not require genetic modifications, and thus the product is uniquely non-GMO.</p>
<p>“Genetic modifications can introduce unintended mutations that increase risk of immunological reactions, and thus we chose to avoid them completely,” said Prof. Nahmias. “One issue of concern in the field, is whether the immortalization process leads to the production of cancer-forming cell lines. However, the work showed that the process developed by our group resulted in cells with normal DNA repair mechanism and without the ability to form tumors.”</p>
<p>Public demand for transparency in food production has been rapidly growing this past decade driven by reports of food borne disease breakouts<em> </em>and videos of animal cruelty. <a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nielseniq.com/global/en/news-center/2022/consumer-demand-for-food-transparency-remains-strong-as-omnichannel-rises/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8E7qJ9D_Q$"">Recent report from the Food Industry Association (FMI)</a> suggests that two-thirds of consumers prefer brands that tell the whole story about how their products are made, and how safe and sustainable they are. This increased demand for more humane, safe, and sustainable methods of meat production accelerated the public excitement for lab-grown or cultured meat. Consumer research studies show that American consumers are eager to try cultured meat, without fully understanding its method of production. Regretfully, most cultured meat companies hold their methods of production as trade secrets, disclosing little information on product composition and safety.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy,” said Prof. Nahmias. “As a parent, I am eternally worried about the nutrition of my children. I want to know that what I give them to eat is safe, healthy, and preferably sustainable. We wanted to ensure that everyone knows where our cell lines came from, how stable and safe they are. That our efficiency is a made matter of public information, leading to a robust and sustainable production of lab-grown meat that everyone can afford.”</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of the study was the demonstration that spontaneous cells grown in suspension could be produced in densities of over to 100 billion cells per liter, more than 17-times the industrial standard. This effectively increases the process yields from 2% to 36% weight per volume. Explains Nahmias, “By analogy, this would allow one to produce about 880 pounds of meat, or about a cow a month, from a vessel the size of a typical refrigerator.”</p>
<p>The team then showed the effective differentiation of fat cells that produced the distinct aroma and flavor of chicken meat.</p>
<p>“We developed a highly efficient differentiation process that uses natural soy lecithin to turn fibroblasts to fat cells in under a week,” said Nahmias. “Combining the cultured cells with plant proteins produced hybrid products in which the aroma and flavor came from lab-grown cells and the proteins were a blend of cells and plant proteins. The paper goes to show a significant preference for lab-grown chicken product in consumer testing.”</p>
<p>Taken together, the paper breaks that “big wall of no” described by Paul Wood and David Humbrid in last year’s <a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8E5Yx1zlA$"">Counter article</a> that challenged the feasibility of lab-grown meat. The Counter analysis assumed a maximum density of 22 to 65 billion cells per liter, and expensive growth factors that are not required by fibroblasts. A production density of 100 billion cells per liter, cuts average projected costs by 3-folds, to about $7.5 per pound of biomass, or $3.3 per pound of hybrid product, within the price range of commercial chicken manufacturing.</p>
<p>Nahmias concludes, “Rising global food companies, like Believer Meats, must commit to full transparency. My kids want to know how their hamburger is made, and I need to look them in the eye and explain why the food I serve them is healthy, safe and sustainable. We must ensure that we, as an industry, provide all the scientific data and information to the public. If we do not rise to this challenge, consumers will search and find disinformation from charlatans online. I want to lead this conversation.”</p>",11236

The initiative aims to enable a shift toward more sustainable consumption by introducing blended products of meat and mycoprotein.</p>
<p>Recent years have shown an increasing demand for more sustainable and healthy alternatives to meat as consumers become more conscious of nutritional aspects and climate impact. Meat is still dominating the protein market, but actors in the food chain now crave a transformation in the system. As meat production alone is responsible for roughly 15%<a href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a> of all greenhouse gas emissions, producers are beginning to acknowledge the need for diversification for more sustainable production.</p>
<p>While plant-based options are more sustainable, recent studies and debates have found them to have some disadvantages regarding nutritional value and uptake. And, so far, plant-based products have yet to meet consumer expectations to the extent that it creates a shift in the market. Even hybrid products mixing plant-based protein and meat have not proven successful. To enable change in consumer behaviour, Mycorena strives to introduce hybrid products adapted to consumer needs.</p>
<p>Mixing meat with more qualitative, nutritious, and sustainable options, such as mycoprotein, ensures that the products maintain the aspects most important to consumers. Initial product validation tests have found that consumers hold health and nutrition equally important to sustainability. Hybrid products could reduce consumers’ meat consumption significantly while providing sufficient nutrients and still enjoying the qualities of meat.</p>
<p><em>‘We need to change how we produce food and reduce meat consumption. However, for everyone to completely cut out meat is unrealistic. Going vegetarian is a big step for many. Hybrid products could solve this issue. By blending meat and mycoprotein, we can reduce the environmental impact while still consciously consuming meat,</em>’ says Sandra Zachrisson, Head of Product Innovation at Mycorena.</p>
<p>Mycorena’s proprietary mycoprotein ingredient Promyc is neutral in taste and with a meat-like texture, making it an excellent option for hybrid blends to maintain the taste and texture customers desire. Hybrids provide a conscious choice for anyone who wants to consume less meat and an easy option for those who struggle with it. Moreover, it provides excellent nutritional value to ensure a balanced and healthy diet. However, despite mycoprotein's advantages, the market has thus far not utilised its potential in a hybrid segment.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mycorena is now developing hybrid prototypes to test mixes and validate products on the market. Beginning with mainstream mince products, produced together with Nybergs Deli, the mycoprotein producer intends to initially test the market and consumer demand with ICA to build a new category.</p>
<p><em>‘We are aware that meat is a food with an environmental impact and that consumption accounts for a part of people’s climate impact. We also believe that total meat consumption will decrease somewhat over time. However, there will still be a large demand for meat products on the market. We believe that there is great potential for hybrid products for consumers who want to continue to enjoy meat but in a slightly smaller amount,’</em> says Mikael Ottestig, Commercial Manager at Nybergs Deli.</p>
<p>By taking on a more consumer-oriented approach, the initiative strives to provide options to families struggling to find alternatives that combine simple and nutritious with conscious and children-friendly. The goal is to reduce food security gaps and make it more accessible to eat healthily and sustainably. Therefore, hybrid products must be affordable and competitively priced to enable consumers to take the step.</p>
<p><em>“We see potential in developing hybrid products in the meat and charcuterie category that facilitates consumers to make more healthy and sustainable choices from the shelf. It is supposed to be easy to choose even more nutritious everyday favourites at ICA,”</em> says Peder Ahlberg, Category Manager Meat/Charcuterie at ICA.</p>
<p>The new segment will provide value both in terms of environmental impact and as a healthy and affordable option to the traditional meat segment. The next step is going to the market to validate the products on a large scale. Mycorena envisions the new food segment of hybrid products as a stepping stone to increase the acceptance of alternative proteins while taking necessary steps toward a sustainable food system.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Madrid, December 21st —</strong> <a href=""https://eatableadventures.com/"">Eatable Adventures</a>, one of the world's leading agri-food accelerators, has presented the data from its annual study <strong>""The State of Foodtech in Spain 2022,""</strong> a report gathering key information on the characterization and investment evolution of the Spanish food-tech entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Broadly, 2022 has been a positive year for the sector in the country. Despite the macroeconomic context, the Spanish startups have been supported by investors, companies and governments, which have taken a much more active role in the growth of the Spanish ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2022, Spain remains in the global top 10 ranking in terms of number of food-tech startups, whose latest census, according to the report, totals <strong>412 startups</strong>. As for the key areas of the food-tech sector, once again this year, 4 major categories were identified, showing a fairly balance among them: <strong>Agritech (24%); Food Production and Transformation (34%); Logistics, Distribution and Retail (25%); and Restaurant Tech (16%).</strong></p>
<p>Spanish startups are solvent at a technological level and have a solid level of development. The percentage of startups that decide <strong>to patent their solutions or generate utility models is growing</strong>: 32,9% of startups have patents, 56,6% have a trademark registration and 29% have a trade secret. There is significant growth in the use of artificial intelligence, with an increase of more than 12 points, compared to last year, as well as in machine learning and IoT, with an increase of 8,5 and 9,6 points, respectively. Regarding the degree of technological development (TRL) of the startups, more than 80% have market-ready solutions and 14% are still at an intermediate stage.</p>
<p>This year, <strong>the total investment figure stands at 268 million euros</strong>, an increase of 9,38% compared to the previous year, not considering the investment round achieved by Glovo (450 million euros). In addition, <strong>the increase in Series A rounds stands out, growing by nearly 20%</strong>, 5 points more than in 2021.</p>
<p>The largest investments have been in startups working in foodservice/retail, but the emergence of the protein alternative stands out among investments. The top 5 startups leading this ranking are <strong>Cover Manager (€52M), Heura (€20M), Good News (€11M), Nova Meat (€6M) and Cubiq (€6M). </strong></p>
<p>“<em>Spain is consolidating its position as a food-tech nation with a flourishing ecosystem and great technological and intellectual solvency, which has attracted the interest of global investors and corporates throughout the year. Proof of this are the investment rounds received by some of the startups of our Spain food-tech portfolio, such as Cocuus, Innomy or Moa Foodtech,”</em> commented José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder at Eatable Adventures.</p>

<p><strong>Düsseldorf, 02.12.2022 —</strong> ProteinDistillery was recently presented with the German Sustainability Award 2023, Next Economy Award (NEA). The Stuttgart-based start-up has managed to develop a unique, innovative process that can be used to extract animal-free, sustainable proteins from brewer's yeast - a residual material from brewing beer - to produce egg, cheese, milk or meat alternatives.</p>
<p>In times of increasing inflation, worsening climate conditions and steady population growth, the ProteinDistillery team wants to offer people a nutrient-rich alternative to conventional, usually meat-based foods that is both sustainably produced and free of toxins. Thus, the company has managed to produce an almost 1:1 copy of animal protein. And in doing so, they are not only upcycling - creating something new from a waste product - but also enabling beer breweries in particular to tap into new sales potential in a challenging market environment. So, to produce the world's most functional and sustainable animal-free protein, the ProteinDistillery breaks down brewer's yeast, and the proteins bound within it, into their individual components. The final product can then be used in a variety of ways in the food industry. Thus, any animal components such as gelatin or the conventional egg, as well as artificial additives such as flavor enhancers, stabilizers, or methylcellulose can be eliminated from food production.</p>
<p>“We are still missing a perfect substitute for animal protein in the food industry - with this claim, we will make a lasting difference.“<br />
– Prof. Dr-Ing. Tomas Kurz, Co-Founder</p>
<p>Production will start in 2023 with our own production plant in Baden-Württemberg, and the concept will subsequently be rolled out worldwide. Our vision of producing several hundred tons of protein ourselves by the end of 2023 means that several thousand tons of protein per year can be supplied by the end of 2025.</p>",11223

This is a crucial step that will enable fish cell production in large scale stirred-tank bioreactors.","<p><strong>Berlin, Dec 13th, 2022. </strong>Bluu Seafood, the leading cultivated fish company in Europe, has successfully adapted its proprietary fish cell lines to growth in suspension without the use of microcarriers or other scaffolds. This is a crucial step that will enable fish cell production in large scale stirred-tank bioreactors.</p>
<p>Establishment of cell suspensions is the latest milestone in a series of R&amp;D breakthroughs that include development of GMO-free immortalized cell-lines and of high-performance growth media without Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Together, these achievements put the young German food tech company in a pole position in the race to industrial-scale seafood production. The required process optimization and scale-up work will take place in Bluu’s new location currently being built in Hamburg (Germany). The facility will include a pilot plant, state-of-the art R&amp;D labs and offices.</p>
<p>“This important achievement allows us to adhere to our ambitious research &amp; development timelines,” says CEO Dr. Sebastian Rakers. “We are on track to kick off pilot production in Hamburg in 2023 and will enter the first phase of the commercialization of our products as planned”.</p>
<p>In general, cell suspensions are the best system for production of animal cells at a truly large scale. Therefore, establishing cell suspensions is an important goal for every company in the cultivated food space. However, it has proven to be extremely difficult to implement such a system for mammalian cells as well as for fish cells. Therefore, many companies either apply genetic engineering technologies or use Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) or Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs).</p>
<p>The German company’s GMO-free approach is based on the generation of small aggregates of cells called spheroids. In these spheroids cells adhere to each other and grow protected while being stirred in the bioreactor. Under normal conditions these spheroids would simply continue to grow into large spheres. Cells in the center would then start dying because nutrients cannot reach the inner layers. “But our bioprocess development team has developed a process that keeps the spheroids below a certain size while maintaining cell proliferation. Thus, the new method involving specific adjustments of growth media composition and bio-processing parameters allows continuous cell production in suspension,” comments Dr Duong T. Nguyen, Bluu’s Director of Research and Bioprocess Innovation.</p>
<p>As no microcarriers or other scaffold materials are used, cells can be harvested and processed without any further treatments. Additional materials add complexity and can influence the taste, texture, and color of the final product. The lack of these gives Bluu maximum flexibility in the downstream use of the cells.</p>
<p>Growing seafood products from cells is a promising solution to relieve the harvesting pressure on our maritime ecosystems, which are further being depleted as seafood consumption skyrockets: while over 90% of our oceans are either overfished or fished to a maximum sustainable level (FAO 2020), seafood sales, which already amount to more than $500B globally, are projected to reach $1T by 2035 (Statista 2022).</p>

<p><strong>Carrefour launches HEROTEIN products</strong><br />
Since September, Carrefour stores in Eastern China have begun featuring eight of HEROTEIN’s signature products, including plant-based dumplings, chicken nuggets, beef patties, microwave RTE pasta, etc. To deepen interaction and understanding of the company’s plant-based offerings among the retail giant’s staff, an internal product tasting and sharing session was held at Carrefour headquarters. The partnership has also seen the roll out of plant-based weekend activities across Carrefour stores, inviting chefs to cook onsite and serve plant-based dishes to customers, encouraging the first trial and converting immediate purchase. Supported by successful launch and well-performed moving rate in Eastern stores, Carrefour plans to distribute HEROTEIN products in northern stores as the next step, by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Carrefour’s online channels, including the official APP, also offer online ordering, realizing the integration of online and offline channels to meet consumer demand for diversity and immediate service.</p>
<p><strong>Offline retail is the key driver of plant-based meat sales</strong><br />
While much has been made of online retail and the convenience it affords to consumers, offline retail remains the top revenue-driving channel for plant-based meats globally. Moving forward, to expand the market for plant-based meat, development of the offline retail channel remains key, hence the importance of the Carrefour/HEROTEIN partnership. Following this partnership, HEROTEIN continues to penetrate more KA stores, and their products have been available in BHG Beijing stores since November. As an aside, while the food service channel was and continues to be affected by the pandemic, the retail channel remains a broad consumer market and engine of growth.</p>
<p>""With regards to offline supermarkets, they are an important outlet for daily shopping by consumers, and naturally have the advantage of long-term retail experience. For the emerging category of plant-based meat, retail channels perform better in market communication. Compared to the foodservice channel, it’s more conducive to brand image and awareness,”said Vicky Lee, CEO of HEROTEIN.</p>
<p><strong>From niche to mainstream, the future of plant-based meat is promising</strong><br />
Carrefour’s first foray into plant-based meat with its exclusive local partner HEROTEIN is a good indication that the alternative protein category is starting to move into mainstream offline retail. It also can be seen as a sign that once niche alternative protein category is gaining growing acceptance, as it becomes a part of the daily diets of regular consumers.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT HEROTEIN</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://heroprotein.cn/"">HEROTEIN</a> is the first domestic company in China to sell plant-based meat products using high moisture extrusion. Founded in 2020 and based in Shanghai, HEROTEIN aims to become the leading brand delivering a tasty and accessible range of plant-based meat products, offering consumers the culinary experience of conventional meat while ensuring food safety and sustainability.</p>",11200

<p><strong>Manchester</strong>, 17.11.2022: Molecular farming start-up Bright Biotech has closed a $3.2 million funding round. The oversubscribed Seed funding round was led by FoodLabs and includes world-class impact investors Big Idea Ventures, CPT Capital, the FoodHack syndicate and business angels. Now, the company will foster its R&amp;D for a new genetic engineering method to make growth factors, expand their team of high-profile scientists and scale their manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>“We are glad to have won such renowned and like-minded investors backing our vision for a more sustainable food system”, said Mohammad El Hajj, co-founder and CEO of Bright Biotech. “With the fresh funding and our growing team of experienced scientists and production experts we are set for rapid commercialisation. Our technology is very timely for the cultivated meat industry, and we are thrilled to be working with our partners and investors to have the first products from our robust, ultra-scalable and sustainable technology available on the market in 2023.”</p>
<p>Driven by the vision to make our food system more sustainable, Bright Biotech is bringing its revolutionary technology to the industry, moving the world one step closer to enjoying the next generation of meat.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling the cultivated meat industry for a more sustainable food industry </strong></p>
<p>Cultivated meat is a solution to the increasing demand for animal proteins as the world continues to experience economic and population growth. Animal factory farming is cruel and not sustainable. Enabled by science, cultivated meat is biologically equivalent to meat from animals. Industrialising cultivated meat will reverse the harm done to animals, people and the environment and we get to keep the enjoyable, delicious, and nutritious meat experiences.</p>
<p>Bright Biotech is a leader in chloroplast-based expression, manufacturing growth factors in plants at minimal cost with staggering yields. Growth factors are necessary proteins that promote cell differentiation, growth and proliferation in the production of cultivated meat. By significantly reducing the price of growth factors, the largest cost drivers of the industry, Bright Biotech will facilitate and enable the industrialisation of cultivated meat tackling a $116 billion global industry by 2040.</p>
<p><strong>Growth factors are critical to achieving price parity for cultivated meat</strong></p>
<p>Despite being used at very low concentrations, growth factors make up at least 55% of the marginal cost of cultivated meat. They can cost several million dollars a gram making them more expensive by weight than diamonds. Up to three tonnes of various growth factors will have to be produced annually for cultivated meat production to scale and gain only one percent of the global protein market. Today, barriers for producing cultivated meat at scale include the very high cost and bottlenecks in the supply of growth factors<em>. </em></p>
<p>“Bright Biotech's approach to harnessing chloroplasts for manufacturing growth factors in plants can be a game changer for the cultivated meat industry and will be a key enabler to achieve price parity”, said Christian Guba, Senior Associate at FoodLabs. “Mohammad and his team have impressed us not only with their deep expertise but also with a pace and progress rarely seen in terms of getting to market. We are very excited to support them in building a global champion.”</p>
<p><strong>An experienced and complementary team </strong></p>
<p>Manchester-based Bright Biotech was founded at the end of 2019 to commercialise the technology of producing valuable proteins in chloroplasts of plants. The company has received numerous awards and endorsements from several distinguished institutions including Educate North Award, The University of Manchester’s Masood Entrepreneurship Centre, EIT Food of the European Union, Innovate UK Edge and Innovation Forum. The co-founders Mohammad El Hajj, Anil Day, Tariq Ali, Farid Khan and Rania Deranieh, are a diverse team of highly qualified and experienced scientists and entrepreneurs. Equipped with a strong academic background in protein production and cell culture from leading educational and research institutions in the UK, the US, Jordan and Lebanon, the team can devise strong risk mitigation plans when technical challenges arise and bring a project to successful completion.</p>

Opo Bio is a B2B cultivated meat company, developing cell lines for the cultivated meat industry from high health status New Zealand livestock. Their first product, primary bovine muscle cells (Opo-Moo) is available for researchers around the world to purchase. Opo’s goal is to be the world leading producer of cell lines for cultivated meat production at scale.</p>
<p>Cultivated meat starts with cells and commercial production requires high-quality, high performing cell lines. As a result, many companies are keeping their cell lines tightly sealed, creating barriers to progress within the industry. Opo’s cell lines will be available for companies to licence. They are initially focussing on cell lines that form cow and pig muscle, fat and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Opo’s first product is aimed at researchers working in the field of cultivated meat. Currently, there are very few cultivated meat relevant cell types available for purchase. Many researchers are using mouse cells or having to isolate the cells within their laboratory, which is a resource intensive process. Opo’s primary cow cells are available for researchers to purchase, and hopes these products will accelerate research progress and transparency within the field.</p>
<p>The Company was founded in July 2022, by Dr Olivia Ogilvie, Dr Laura Domigan and Dr Vaughan Feisst based on research developed in Dr Laura Domigan’s lab at University of Auckland. Opo’s Seed round was led by Matū Fund, followed by Booster, The Inventors' Fund, Booster Innovation Fund and Angels.</p>",11198

<li><strong>The simple and effective method combines Language Models (LM) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict protein subcellular localization — with broader implications for function prediction.</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>Wednesday, November 16, 2022 (Alameda, CA) – <a href=""https://shiru.com"">Shiru</a>, a functional ingredients discovery company, announced today that it will present a new state-of-the-art AI method for predicting protein subcellular localization, with broad implications for food alternative proteins, health care, pharma, personal care, and more. </p>
<p>The paper, entitled “Improving Protein Subcellular Localization Prediction with Structural Prediction &amp; Graph Neural Networks,” will be presented at <a href=""https://nips.cc/"">NeurIPS</a>, the leading conference of the AI research community, on Saturday, December 3, 2022, at the <a href=""https://www.mlsb.io/"">Machine Learning for Structural Biology</a> Workshop.</p>
<p>Predicting where a protein localizes or resides in a cell is a huge challenge in biotechnology. Where a protein resides is an important indicator of its function and manufacturability. Many processes, such as disease mechanisms, drug performance, regulation of metabolic processes, and signaling cascades, depend on a protein’s localization. </p>
<p>Previous work in the field has shown how Language Models (LM) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can independently provide efficient localization predictions when trained on protein DNA sequences and 3D structures, respectively. Shiru AI researchers created a method for combining the two different kinds of protein representations used by LM and GNN, then used real-world data to show how ensembling them outperforms the reigning state-of-the-art method.</p>
<p>“This paper validates our approach and offers a generalized method that opens new possibilities toward creating a sequence-to-function map of the protein universe,” says Geoffroy Dubourg-Felonneau, Shiru’s Machine Learning Lead and the paper’s lead author. “We are continually developing new and improved methods for protein representation, and we show in this case that the combination of protein structure information and language modeling yields a significant improvement on the task of subcellular localization prediction.”</p>
<p>“Shiru is pioneering the use of advanced machine learning techniques to reveal proteins with similar function but dissimilar sequence and structure relative to a target protein,” says Lawrence Lee, Shiru’s Chief Technology Officer. “This new approach enhances our ability to uncover the hidden food functionality of proteins.” </p>
<p>The new AI method is the latest from Shiru’s science and technology team. In September 2022, Shiru was awarded a <a href=""https://www.shiru.com/post/ingredient-biotech-startup-shiru-awarded-key-patent-for-protein-discovery-platform/"">key patent</a> for its protein discovery platform, which covers machine learning combined with lab analysis for developing naturally-occurring proteins as functional food ingredients. Shiru’s <a href=""https://www.shiru.com/approach/"">Flourish</a>™ technology is in active use in partnerships with global food leaders Puratos and CP Kelco.

<p><strong>Chicago, IL </strong>(November 7, 2022) -<a href=""https://theosplantbased.com/""> THEO’s Plant-Based</a> has entered the $7 billion plant-based food space with a focus on honoring vegetables for what they already are – tasty, nutritious, and planet-friendly. By creating Certified Organic, better-for-you plant-based meats that deliver on both flavor and nutrition, THEO’s is on a mission to lead the world into a cleaner, more nutritious and sustainable food system where vegetables are once again the leading ingredients in plant-based cooking. The brand soft-launched on August 17, 2022 with its premier product, a first-of-its-kind BEET Jerky, and has plans to roll out additional lines of vegetable-forward fare in 2023 and beyond. </p>
<p>With a commitment to helping people eat more vegetables through the development of innovative, vegetable-forward products, THEO’s is putting plants back at the center of plant-based eating. While early innovators have made significant strides in shifting the global narrative around plant-based products, due to their focus on creating meat-mimicking tastes and textures, there is still a gaping hole in the industry – health and nutrition. THEO’s envisions a future where organic, regenerative vegetables are at the center of the plate – and where neither taste nor nutritional value are compromised. The vision of Co-Founder Theo Mourad, who observed the need for a brand that delivers the delicious vegetable experience he was used to creating as a cook in one of the world’s most respected farm-to-table restaurants, THEO’s was born.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to officially bring our brand to market, beginning with our delectable BEET Jerky,” said Mourad. “Our goal is to actively change the way people think about plant-based foods by showcasing vegetables to be savory, delicious plant-based meats that are also clean and genuinely healthy.” </p>
<p>“We are equally as passionate about supporting the environment,” added Co-Founder Aaron Brodkey. “THEO’s stands for high-quality, real, vegetable-forward, organic, and plant-based food, but we go beyond these adjectives to always pursue better quality and sustainability in the products we create. We support vegetable farmers who respect and maintain the environment, and everything we do is rooted in sustainability through our supply chain, manufacturing, packaging, and more.”</p>
<p>Childhood friends whose paths continued to cross into adulthood through their shared passion for plant-based food, Mourad and Brodkey teamed up to bring THEO’s to life. Mourad brings 10 years of experience in the food industry, having most recently worked in the kitchen of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, the world-renowned two-starred Michelin restaurant in New York’s Hudson Valley. Throughout his tenure in the industry as a cook, farmhand, volunteer, and student, he became fascinated in the relationship between farming, cooking, and food. Brodkey, who holds a degree in sustainable food systems, has worked in the plant-based food space for nearly five years, most recently serving as Program Manager at Big Idea Ventures, the most active alternative protein VC and accelerator. </p>
<p>THEO’s products are masterfully developed with chef-driven techniques that result in superior flavor and texture. At the core of each recipe are Certified Organic, minimally processed, gluten-free, Paleo, vegan, whole vegetable, and nutrient-rich ingredients. THEO’s BEET Jerky is crafted from organic beets and curated spice blends, which is available in three flavors: Sea Salt &amp; Cracked Pepper, Sesame-Ginger Teriyaki, and Savory BBQ. </p>
<p>BEET Jerky is currently available for pre-order online at<a href=""http://www.theosplantbased.com/""> www.theosplantbased.com</a> and will be available in select specialty shops throughout the Midwest and Northeast regions, including Whole Foods Market and Pop Up Grocer, in Q1 of 2023. THEO’s products will also be available to order on a number of top-tier e-commerce retailers including Amazon in early 2023.</p>
<p>In Summer 2022, THEO’s was selected by Whole Foods to participate in their coveted accelerator program as the only Midwestern brand within its cohort. The program offers mentorship directly from Whole Foods experts, tailored education for small and emerging producers, the potential for financial support to promote business growth, and placement on the shelves of the brands’ home city’s Whole Foods Market stores, with opportunities for regional and national expansion. </p>
<p>In 2023, THEO’s will bring to market more innovative, clean recipes rooted in the brand’s organic, vegetable-forward ethos. Upon launching, the brand will participate in 1% for the Planet, a global organization that accelerates smart environmental giving, and will donate at least 1% of their annual sales to further healthy food access in Chicago.</p>

<li>Backed by ADM and Temasek’s Nurasa, formerly Asia Sustainable Foods Platform</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Singapore, 26 October 2022 -</strong> ScaleUp Bio, a new, Singapore-homegrown precision fermentation solutions provider – a joint venture company of ADM and Temasek’s Nurasa – is positioning itself to emerge as a key enabler towards unlocking innovation for global food tech start-ups needing dedicated food-grade precision fermentation laboratory facilities and more.</p>
<p>ScaleUp Bio will open two dedicated food-grade precision fermentation facilities in Singapore during 2023. These new facilities will be the first of their kind in Singapore open to promising start-ups from anywhere in the world needing research and development assistance.</p>
<p>“Addressing urgent food security and supply issues driven by climate change and exacerbated by traditional food production sources – and in line with emerging consumer demands for more sustainably developed alternative proteins and other foods – has been a real challenge due to a lack of dedicated food-grade laboratory facilities, business guidance and market assistance for start-ups,” said Francisco Codoñer, ScaleUp Bio CEO.</p>
<p>“This has been because most CDMOs around the world cater first and foremost to pharmaceutical or biofuel industry needs. Which means start-ups and other early-stage firms often must resort to expensive and unpredictable laboratory capacities, often in an environment that was not meant for food. Building their own pilot facilities on the other hand would set up a high capital threshold out of the gate. We have designed ScaleUp Bio’s entire business model specifically to empower these young companies with the facilities, capabilities, and resources they have long needed to scale and succeed in today’s marketplace.”</p>
<p><strong>Two world-class, dedicated food-grade precision fermentation facilities opening in 2023</strong></p>
<p>ScaleUp Bio’s first facility opening in the first half of 2023 will be a joint laboratory developed under a new, multi-year partnership with the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)’s Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI), enabling delivery of tailored start-up infrastructure and service offerings. This facility, designed especially for research and development for start-ups and emerging food tech companies, will be able to support up to 100 litres of fermentation and downstream processing capacity, with analysis, testing and process optimisation capabilities. It will be located at Nurasa’s Food Tech Innovation Centre (FTIC) at Biopolis, a research and development hub in central Singapore.</p>
<p>The second facility – also scheduled for commercial launch during the second half of 2023 – will offer close to 2,300 square metres of space where start-ups and early-stage food tech companies from around the world can access up to 10,000 litres of fermentation and associated downstream processing capacity, with experts on-hand to continue the process optimisation and scale-up journey. This facility will also serve as ScaleUp Bio’s headquarters and will be located at LOGOS Food21, in Tuas, an emerging food manufacturing zone in the western part of Singapore.</p>
<p>Beyond physical laboratory facilities and technical expertise, ScaleUp Bio also offers food tech startups a comprehensive array of opportunities from its extensive business ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Offering access to Asia and an innovation ecosystem supported by global leaders</strong></p>
<p>“We understand the challenges faced by young firms seeking to navigate the complex regulations, cultures, and tastes across Asia. Thus, it makes perfect sense for us to launch our global offering from Singapore. From here, we can offer smart market entry to fast-growing Asian populations hungry for alternative sustainable food sources from one of the world’s great innovation centres,” Codoñer emphasised.</p>
<p>Through a holistic ecosystem of industry experts, partner organisations and resources from across ScaleUp Bio’s parent companies, precision fermentation start-ups will have access to an unprecedented array of resources and potential relationships to ensure commercial success. ADM is a global leader in nutrition and agricultural origination and processing and Nurasa is a new company focused on accelerating the commercialisation and adoption of sustainable food across Asia and is in turn wholly owned by Temasek, a global investment management company in Singapore.</p>
<p>“Whether you are a home-grown innovator here in Singapore or from across Asia – or a food tech company from anywhere in the world – we want to hear from you. With our new facilities, access to top-tier talent, resources, and capital, we offer a tremendous platform for young companies seeking to springboard their products to global scale and success,” concluded Codoñer.</p>
<p><strong>Invitation to attend ScaleUp Bio’s In-person breakout session on 28 October 2022 at the 5th AsiaPacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit in Singapore</strong></p>
<p>Interested parties are warmly invited to attend a special breakout session of the 5th Asia Pacific AgriFood Innovation Summit on Friday, 28 October 2022 at 2.50 pm, in Singapore, when ScaleUp Bio’s CEO Francisco Codoñer will share in an engaging session:</p>

<p><strong>London UK, 20th October 2022:</strong> <a href=""https://cewcomms.mxspruce.com/FXxqh2bZQfSwr3wyS/l/ueC8SotkcmblnFey8?messageId=LlQ3kDXPXkRCDLpvP&amp;rn=&amp;re=gInJ3buQncvBXZy5WalR3byBHQvxGblhmI&amp;sc=false"">Hoxton Farms</a> has announced a $22 million Series A round to build a pilot facility for producing cultivated fat: the missing ingredient necessary to make meat alternatives delicious, realistic and versatile. After receiving regulatory approval, Hoxton Farms will sell cultivated fat as a B2B ingredient for meat alternatives.</p>
<p>Since raising its $3.6m Seed round led by Founders Fund last year, Hoxton Farms has demonstrated the power of its computational platform. The team uses machine learning and mathematical modelling to develop proprietary bioreactors and low-cost animal-free culture media – the nutrient-rich broth used to feed cells. Now that Hoxton Farms has proven the enabling technology for its production platform, the startup is building a 13,000 sq ft pilot facility in Shoreditch, East London, to scale up its manufacturing capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Max Jamilly, Co-founder of Hoxton Farms, said</strong>, “At Hoxton Farms, we are obsessed with fat. Fat is the single most important sensory component in all of the meat that we eat. Using cultivated fat alongside plant proteins, we have shown that we can make products with the juiciness and flavour that plant-based meat has been missing. We’re now building our pilot plant in central London so that we can show visitors a new way of making the same delicious meat.”</p>
<p><strong>Jamilly continued</strong>, “Growth in the plant-based meat market has slowed to a crawl. There is more choice than ever before but consumers miss the delicious flavour and juicy texture of traditional meat. Dollar sales and market share of plant-based meat stagnated in the USA in 20211 and almost 60 percent of US consumers are reluctant to try plant-based meat due to its taste2. Animal agriculture has a greater worldwide impact on climate change than transport emissions and occupies 77 percent of all agricultural land even though it supplies only 17 percent of our food3. But meat alternatives need significant improvement before we can make a dent in the intensive animal agriculture industry and shut down the last factory farm on Earth. This is where Hoxton Farms comes in.”</p>
<p>Existing “alternative proteins” underperform due to plant oils. That's because coconut, sunflower, palm, and canola oil taste funky, degrade quickly, burn easily, melt inconsistently, and aren’t as healthy as they seem. Manufacturers add flavourings and other ingredients to the label in an attempt to make up for the deficiencies of plant oils, but this only makes products unhealthy and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>To deliver on the promise of meat made in a better way, Hoxton Farms cultivates real animal fat in bioreactors. Its customers combine fat with plant-based protein, bringing together the best of both cell-cultured and plant-based products. They create blended meat alternatives that give consumers the taste, texture, and nutrition that they expect – and at a fairer price.</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steele, Co-founder of Hoxton Farms, said</strong>, “Cost and scale are two of the biggest challenges in the cellular agriculture industry, but they aren’t talked about enough. Since we started Hoxton Farms, we have been laser-focussed on solving these problems and, thanks to our computational approach, have made significant breakthroughs. We’ve also built an incredible team, novel technology and important customer partnerships. Collaborative Fund and Fidelity are the perfect partners as we build our pilot plant and demonstrate our scale-out production process.”</p>
<p>Hoxton Farms is inviting Londoners to imagine a new kind of city farm. Traditional methods for commercial cell culture are based on building larger and larger bioreactors. This approach makes sense for the pharmaceutical industry but it’s no match for the vast scales and low costs needed to produce food. Instead, Hoxton Farms has built a “scaled out” approach using many smaller bioreactors connected through software and automation. The team have proven that this dramatically lowers the cost of producing commercial-scale cultivated fat. The startup’s new pilot facility will demonstrate this novel approach at significant volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Bakalar, Partner at Collaborative Fund, added</strong>, “At Collaborative Fund, we’ve been investing in better ways to produce meat for over a decade, including in companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. These brands have done a phenomenal job delivering on the protein side of the equation, but we still need a breakthrough in fat to compete with conventional meat on taste, texture, health, and cost. We’re convinced that Hoxton Farms is the company that will deliver on that promise.”</p>
<p>Cultivating fat may be less challenging than cultivating muscle, but it's still impossible to produce fat at global scales using existing methods. Instead, Hoxton Farms uses cutting-edge computational biology and Bayesian optimisation to reduce costs, accelerate timelines, and produce a customised product unimaginable even a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Uhrig, Partner at Fine Structure Ventures, commented</strong>, “We are extremely impressed with the technology that Hoxton Farms has developed. Combining machine learning, biology and engineering has uncovered hidden insights that dramatically improve performance throughout every stage of the production process. The proprietary scale-out approach also removes the risk of scaling beyond pilot and reduces the cost of producing cultivated fat. We are very excited to work closely with the Hoxton Farms team over the next few years.”</p>
<p>In addition to building its pilot facility, the Series A will enable Hoxton Farms to submit regulatory dossiers, further develop its customer partnerships to demonstrate its cultivated fat in products and improve the cost of growing cultivated fat at scale. Currently a team of over 20, they expect to reach 50 by the end of 2023. </p>

The company also shared it is in the final stages of closing a bridge funding round.","<p><em>Signs agreement to design the first-of-its-kind commercial manufacturing plant solution in the region, with government support under NextGen FDI initiative.</em></p>
<p>(PALO ALTO, CA – 10.20.22) -- Change Foods has signed an agreement with KEZAD Group to design a dedicated commercial manufacturing plant for production of its animal-free dairy in Abu Dhabi, with the support of the Ministry of Economy of the UAE under the NextGen FDI initiative. The company also shared it is in the final stages of closing a bridge funding round.</p>
<p>The planned facility will be the first of its kind in the region to produce animal-free milk protein, casein, the main ingredient in cheesemaking. Change Foods’ casein is bioidentical to the traditional dairy version but will be entirely animal-free -- thus made with a fraction of the environmental impact of animal-derived dairy. The strategic location of the facility with multimodal connectivity would also provide a shipping and distribution network to serve the rapidly growing Middle East and Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“We are honored to be a part of the UAE’s NextGen FDI initiative and grateful for the strategic partnership with KEZAD Group” said David Bucca, Founder and CEO of Change Foods. “NextGen FDI is prioritizing successful scaling of new sustainable food technologies like ours that offer significant environmental and economic development benefits. The strategic alignment behind our company’s vision to help transition the world to more sustainable food systems by scaling new food production technology was clear from the start.” </p>
<p>Change Foods is pioneering precision fermentation technology that integrates centuries-old fermentation techniques with the latest bioengineering tools. The milk proteins produced via precision fermentation are identical to those made by cows, so the resulting cheese retains its authentic texture, taste, stretch and melting characteristics of traditional dairy cheese.</p>
<p>Change Foods is focused primarily on the growing cheese industry, an $83 billion global food category and one of the world’s most popular foods. “Raising animals for food is an inefficient and resource-intensive process that materially contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions,” said Bucca, “we think we can be an influence of positive transformation for this dynamic and growing industry. This will be a stellar example of how embracing new technologies can help us overcome regional food security challenges.”</p>
<p>With this announcement, the UAE continues its foray into the world food innovation stage. The government will showcase its commitment in 2024 when Dubai hosts COP28, the United Nations’ Climate Change Conference. The UN is working to galvanize global action and establish policies and investments to actively support decarbonization of energy and agricultural sectors to limit the planet warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in accordance with the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>“Change Foods is an outstanding example of the kind of emerging food technology investments the United Arab Emirates wishes to make in shaping a sustainable, secure and affordable food system that can serve growing local and regional demand,” said H.E. Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade.</p>
<p>“Initiatives such as NextGen FDI are helping to accelerate the development of a knowledge-based economy, one in which advanced technologies can be applied the challenges of sustainable manufacturing and food security. We are excited to welcome Change Foods to the UAE and further catalyze the nation’s food-tech ecosystem, which will help reduce our reliance on imports, enhance local production and inspire further innovation,” he added.</p>
<p>Bucca indicated his team is now in the midst of the facility design stages.</p>
<p><strong>Change Foods </strong>is creating animal-free dairy foods by leveraging precision fermentation technology, starting with cheese. By harnessing the power of microbes instead of animals to create real dairy proteins and fats, the company is producing animal-free dairy foods that are indistinguishable from their animal-based predecessors in taste and texture, while delivering products that are more sustainable and better for you.

Along with this success, Mewery reports investment from Credo Ventures and Purple Ventures, closing their raise of almost a million dollars in their pre-seed round. </p>
<p><em>""The money will help us retrofit our new labs, expand our team with additional scientists, and accelerate the introduction of our prototype. Of course, we will also invest in further intellectual property protection,</em>"" says Mewery founder Roman Lauš, who was one of the main organizers of the Future Port festival, a future-positive tech festival where the idea of setting up a company with significant social impact was initially conceived.</p>
<p><em>""For us at Credo, Mewery is our first investment in a food-tech startup</em><em>,</em><em> and we decided to go for it because Roman and his team convinced us that their approach to meat culturing is extremely innovative on a global scale and could contribute to a significant shift in the way cultivated meat is brought to market. Roman and I have known each other for many years</em><em>,</em><em> and the team he has put together is a top in the industry,</em>"" comments Credo Ventures partner Ondřej Bartoš on the investment.</p>
<p>Mewery's scientific team has successfully tested their target concept. The goal of the startup is to develop pork products in the lab that are cultivated from mammalian cells through a proprietary microalgae-based growth medium. ""<em>We were able to validate our method in different environments and obtain a proof of concept. By the end of the year, we should have the first prototypes</em>,"" reveals Roman Lauš. </p>
<p><strong>What makes the Mewery method groundbreaking? </strong></p>
<p>Fetal Bovine Serum, which contains growth factors and certain hormones, in addition to base nutrients, is the standard used for many cell culture applications. However, the use of FBS is both costly and reliant upon the slaughter of animals.</p>
<p>""<em>Our microalgae-based cultivation medium is FBS-free. This was the main goal we set at the very beginning—a cultivation medium without animal products. It means meat without animal death. In practice, we have confirmed that it is possible to effectively use our proprietary medium that allows mammalian cells to continue to grow just without the use of FBS. In addition, we have saved 70% of the costs compared to conventional cultivation methods</em>,"" explains Lauš. Thanks to this approach, Mewery was selected among the top 15 startups in the food-tech sector from more than 300 applicants to the Big Idea Ventures accelerator almost a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Why lab-grown meat? </strong></p>
<p>While there are already various meat substitutes on the market, because they are mostly plant-based, the final texture and taste tend to be significantly different from their animal-based versions. Mewery wants to change that by bringing ground meat, meatballs, sausages, and, in the future, steak to the market.</p>
<p>""<em>We want to offer a healthy and sustainable alternative to conventional meat, which means allowing meat-loving people to choose meat that is slaughter-free, pathogen-free, and has the same taste and texture they are used to</em>,"" explains the startup's founder, adding that their initial final products will be similar to ground meat in texture, but the composition will be different<em>—</em>in addition to muscle and fat, microalgae will be added, creating a one-of-a-kind product. ""<em>Microalgae gives the meat the so-called fortification label—food enriched with other beneficial ingredients—such as vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, fiber, and essential fatty acids, etc.,</em>"" concludes Roman Lauš.</p>
<p>""<em>Although it is a long-term view, we are convinced that alternative proteins produced on the basis of animal cells will represent a major shift towards a more sustainable, humane, and, we believe, healthier future of food. And we see great potential in Mewery to be a major contributor to this evolution,</em>"" adds Jan Stanek, founding partner of Purple Ventures.</p>

<p>The London-based food tech brand first secured a Smart Grant from Innovate UK, the UK government research and innovation department’s highly competitive flagship award.</p>
<p>The company then secured its first VC investment from Beeches Group, a prolific food and agriculture investment fund backed by the owners of Noble Foods.</p>
<p>Building on its success, Adamo Foods has now been selected as winner of the SHAKE Climate Change 2022 cohort, a prestigious annual competition led by World-renowned Rothamsted Research that seeks to support the most promising innovations in sustainable food production.</p>
<p>The company is using the funding to complete its development of Europe’s first convincing beef steak alternative. Pierre Dupuis, Founder and CEO said:</p>
<p><em>“It’s a hugely exciting time in the alt-protein space, with meat alternatives more popular than ever. But we see a huge gap in the market for realistic and healthy alternatives to whole cuts. Whole cuts represent 85% of the $1trn meat market but are virtually absent in meat alternatives. We’re aiming to change that.”</em></p>
<p>‘Whole cuts’ refers to steaks and filets as opposed to shredded pieces of meat such as burgers and nuggets.</p>
<p>Adamo Foods is using a proprietary fermentation process to create clean-label whole-cut “steaks” based on a single, natural superfood called fungal mycelium. Adamo Foods’ mycelium strain is packed with fiber, is a complete protein source with all 9 essential amino acids, and is inherently fibrous, delivering a unique muscle-like structure.</p>
<p><em>“We’re working on an exciting new technology to take these products to the next level, and are hugely grateful to our new investors for recognising its potential. The funding takes us one step further on our mission to remove animals from our broken food system.”</em></p>

The round was led by international investors including Corporación Cervino, Rockstart, Zubi Capital, Eatable Adventures and the National Center for Technology and Food Safety (CNTA), who have taken equity stakes in the company to scale the startup’s disruptive technology and promote a much more sustainable and healthier protein consumption alternative in other markets.</p>
<p>The leading Argentinian team, composed by CEO and co-founder Juan Pablo de Giacomi, biotechnologist COO and co-founder Pablo Sánchez Rey, and mycologist CSO and Technology Partner Francisco Kuhar, has dedicated years of research to the properties of mushroom-based proteins and their benefits for the health of people and the planet.</p>
<p>Innomy is the third Spanish food-tech startup announcing its first funding round after successfully completing the acceleration program Spain Foodtech developed by Eatable Adventures, in collaboration with ICEX Spain Export and Investment and the National Center for Technology and Food Safety (CNTA) and the Rockstart AgriFood program. Disruptive startups Cocuus and Moa Foodtech were also selected in Spain Foodtech program.</p>
<p>Juan Pablo de Giacomi, CEO and founder of Innomy states <em>""We were born as a platform to channel many years of research in the field of the properties of edible mushrooms. Our mission is to respond to consumers that demand good food products for their health but also for the planet's wellbeing. We want to reach new markets and bring our product to thousands of people"".</em></p>
<p>Mycelium, a filamentous, protein-rich ingredient extracted from the root structure of mushrooms is considered to be one of the most promising sources of protein for the future. Its quality in terms of nutrition was recognized by scientists a long time ago, but its current production for human consumption is not yet widespread. Furthermore, the fact that fungi do not produce cholesterol or significant amounts of saturated fats has redirected the attention of the food industry towards them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder of Eatable Adventures notes <em>""We are very proud to be part of this new milestone that consolidates the leadership of the Spanish foodtech ecosystem. In the last few months, we have managed to raise Funding rounds of an average of 1.8M for three of the startups that have been selected in our acceleration program. We continue to bet on disruptive technologies that impact the way food is produced and consumed, ensuring food safety for all"".</em></p>
<p>Mark Durno, Managing Partner AgriFood of Rockstart said: <em>“At Rockstart, purpose driven and determined founders are central to our investment selection. In the case of Innomy, the founding team is composed of specialists in mycelium and have all shown amazing commercial insight and humble curiosity during the mentor sessions throughout our accelerator program. We are delighted to make our second investment in the company.”</em></p>
<p><em>""With the entry into the capital we formalize the collaboration we have maintained in recent years to develop Innomy's proprietary technology. And now, with this financial injection, it will be possible to bring this technology to the market and continue contributing to transforming the future of food to make it healthier, more sustainable, safer and available to everyone</em>,"" said Héctor Barbarin, CEO of CNTA.</p>
<p>In the context of the current global environmental and demographic challenges, meat alternatives, such as mycelium, are an effective solution to reduce meat production effects, which are responsible for almost 60% of all greenhouse gasses generated by food production, according to FAO data.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, MA </strong>— Boston Bioworks, a provider of advanced fermentation process development and scale-up services to bio-ingredient companies, formally announced its launch today. The company brings extensive experience in commercial-scale fermentation to an industry that’s facing significant bottlenecks. Fermentation-based companies in the alternative protein sector raised <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/15/investors-salivate-over-food-tech-companies-perfecting-precision-fermentation/"">$1.7 billion in 2021</a>, a threefold increase from 2020, with <a href=""https://www.bcg.com/press/23march2021-alternative-protein-market-reach-290-billion-by-2035"">Boston Consulting Group</a> and others projecting the sector will continue to expand rapidly. As a result of the steep increase in investment and company formation, the sector is now facing severe supply shortages in fermentation scale-up expertise and assets.</p>
<p>Boston Bioworks Co-Founder and CEO Michael Tai, Ph.D. served until August as Head of Bioprocess at Motif FoodWorks, where he developed the industrial production process for Motif’s heme ingredient, and prior to that worked as fermentation project leader at ADM. Tai is joined by co-founders Mert Sahin, a cell biology Ph.D. who previously served as a Chief Marketing Officer within Imaging at GE Healthcare, and Ted Netland, an MIT MBA who previously worked as an analyst at Cambridge Associates and as Director of New Ventures at Lever VC Advisers.</p>
<p>Tai and his co-founders launched Boston Bioworks to address key sector bottlenecks, offering a first-of-its-kind platform for fermentation-based companies to scale products from benchtop-scale to commercial-scale more quickly and without expensive CapEx requirements. This platform will enable companies producing ingredients from precision fermentation (such as meat and dairy proteins, fats, flavorings, and similar ingredients) or from biomass fermentation (such as mycelium) to seamlessly bridge the gap between strain engineering and industrial-scale production.</p>
<p>“We decided to launch Boston Bioworks after experiencing firsthand severe industry bottlenecks for process development and scale-up services, bottlenecks which are costing fermentation companies time and leading to wasted CapEx spending,” noted Tai. “We’re strongly encouraged by the enthusiastic market response we’ve already seen for these services. Although we’ve just launched the company this month, we’ve already signed four clients from several alternative protein categories and will begin process development and pilot-scale batches for these clients in the coming weeks. With the influx of capital into the fermentation sector and the rapid increase in the number of startups and products being developed, there is clearly a need for this scale-up expertise and capacity.”</p>",11154

<p>ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, September 13, 2022. Shiru, a functional ingredients discovery company, today announced it was awarded a key patent on a high-tech approach for discovering proteins for the food industry. U.S. Patent No. 11,439,159 was issued today and is entitled “System for identifying and developing individual naturally-occurring proteins as food ingredients by machine learning and database mining combined with empirical testing for a target food function.”</p>
<p>The patent describes Shiru’s unique approach for revealing the elusive “sequence-to-food-function” map. Using an iterative ""predict-build-test"" loop, Shiru first uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to interrogate a database of tens of millions of naturally occurring non-animal protein sequences for candidate proteins that have desired functional characteristics. Select candidates are then screened via high-throughput strain engineering and protein function assays to identify proteins that can be mass-produced via precision fermentation. The experimental data are fed back into the models to continuously improve the accuracy and efficiency of the functional predictions.</p>

Supported by renowned international food tech expert investors, the startup plans to launch its first industrial production of animal-free premium cheese within the next 24 months.</strong></p>
<p>The €2M pre-seed round was led by Beast, Big Idea Ventures (itself supported by Bel Group, AAK, and others) and Trellis Road. “Beast is super excited to partner with Nutropy on bringing premium animal-free cheese to the world. We are particularly impressed with Nathalie and Maya’s innovative vision for scaling fermentation processes and their dedication to producing innovative, impactful products. We are proud to welcome them to the growing Beast family of climate deeptech companies”, says Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, founder and managing partner at Beast. The round was supported by VegCapital, FoodHack, Techmind (through Jericho, its investors club dedicated to sustainable food), a few international business angels with experience in technology, food technology and agriculture and the French government.</p>
<p>Paris-based Nutropy has developed a new technology that gives animal-free cheese products the texture and creaminess that people crave in cheese. This is made possible by a protein called casein, which is the first milk protein that Nutropy is producing through its technology. “We’ve long been convinced of the critical role of casein in the shift away from animal cheese products. After speaking to the majority of casein startups globally we decided to invest in Nutropy as we were very impressed with the team’s technical ability and the milestones achieved in such a short period of time”, said Anna Ottosson, founding partner at Trellis Road. Nutropy is also developing dairy fatty acids and has carefully selected cheese cultures to produce real cheese flavors.</p>
<p>These innovations allow for the next generation of animal-free cheeses that replicate the taste, texture and nutrition of animal cheese. ""We are excited about Nutropy’s technology and the quality of the products the team has been able to produce. I tried their premium cheese at one of our events, and the texture and taste were indistinguishable from premium, animal-based cheese. Using bio-identical ingredients is a game changer,"" says Andrew D. Ive, Founder and Managing General Partner of Big Idea Ventures.</p>
<p>“As cheese lovers, we know the importance of cheese in our gastronomic culture and want to offer consumers a wide range of cheeses free of lactose and dietary cholesterol that are produced in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner”, said Nathalie Rolland, CEO of Nutropy. Nutropy’s process has the potential to use significantly fewer natural resources and limit the greenhouse gases and water pollution that accompany animal-produced dairy products.</p>
<p>The international cheese market is worth $200B and growing. Nutropy’s innovative approach, and its close collaboration with industrial cheese producers and French cheese specialists, mean it is primed to lead the development of a B2B “cheesable milk solution” producing many types of cheese to expand the global cheese market to new frontiers.</p>

<p>Leuven, 1st September 2022 – Fermented foods are consumed in Europe and across the globe. Especially in the past decades, fermented foods have been hailed for their nutritional and perceived health benefits. Yet little is known about the impact of fermentation on human health or how fermentation can be leveraged to enhance the use of sustainable plant-based raw materials. The new EU research project HealthFerm, a collaboration of 22 partners from across Europe, will shed light on this forward-looking topic. Funded through the European Union’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), the project has a budget of EUR 13.1 million (11.3 and 1.8 from EU and SERI, respectively) over the next four years. HealthFerm is coordinated by KU Leuven, Belgium, and the consortium kicks off its activities today.</p>
<p>Fermented foods are ‘foods made through desired microbial growth and enzymatic conversions of food components’<a href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>.<strong> </strong>Humans have consumed different types of these foods for thousands of years. First, fermentation processes occurred spontaneously rather than intentionally, and the main benefit was the increased shelf-life of foods. In the 19th century, people started to understand the actual fermentation processes better. It was not until the early 20th century that fermented foods gained a reputation for being beneficial to health. At present, they are more popular than ever due to their perceived healthiness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, little concrete evidence exists for their actual health benefits. There are few dedicated studies describing the mechanisms behind any impact of fermented foods on human health, and in-depth knowledge of how fermentation microorganisms and fermented foods interact with the human gut microbiome is missing. Only with the availability of such knowledge will it be possible to design fermented foods with optimal health benefits rather than relying on spontaneous fermentation processes. At the same time, there is a global trend toward a more sustainable food system by reducing the consumption of animal-based foods. Unfortunately, using plant-based ingredients in many meat and dairy analogue products remains challenging due to, e.g. flavour or processing issues. In Healthferm, new plant-based fermentations will be designed to improve the palatability of plant-based ingredients and leverage their use in a range of foods. </p>
<p>These areas are where HealthFerm will leave its mark: The project has been established to understand better the interaction between food fermentation microbiomes, fermented grain-based foods and the human gut microbiome and how they support human health. At the same time, HealthFerm will use these newly gained insights alongside microbial resources and fermentation technology to develop novel, healthy and nutritious foods based on legumes (pea and faba bean) and cereals (wheat and oat), with particular attention to the inclusion of side stream stemming from the processing of these grains. Consumer attitudes towards fermented foods will be studied throughout Europe.</p>
<p>“The research undertaken in HealthFerm will potentially have a wide-reaching impact on not only individual, societal and planetary health, but also the wider EU food industry through greater resource efficiency and increased use of plant-based raw materials,” explains Prof. Christophe Courtin, Professor of Food Biochemistry at KU Leuven and Coordinator of the project.</p>
<p>At the heart of HealthFerm lies a community-science approach for developing innovative plant-based food fermentations. Citizens, artisans and companies will collect food fermentation microbiomes in Europe and worldwide to be analysed to map the biodiversity of microorganisms used to ferment different foods. HealthFerm will build on this knowledge to devise novel foodstuffs that improve the sensorial and health benefits of both traditional foods, like (sourdough) bread, as well as sustainable plant-based dairy and meat alternatives. A specially developed online interface will support this effort.</p>
<p>Prof. Courtin adds: “Of particular interest to us is also how dietary changes including fermented foods can reduce inflammation and the risk for chronic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic diseases. This we would like to understand better based on human intervention studies and will do so in comparison to a standard plant-based diet. Alongside, we will also optimise fermentation processes and investigate further the consumer perceptions towards fermented and plant-based foods in Europe.”</p>
<p>The HealthFerm consortium responsible for this innovative endeavour comprises academic, clinical and industrial partner institutions from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Sweden and The Netherlands. Two Swiss partners complete the consortium. The project officially kicks off its activities with the first meeting in Leuven, Belgium, on September 1 and 2, 2022.</p>

<p>The first assessment of the field’s potential in Australia is outlined in a white paper released by Cellular Agriculture Australia (CAA), that shows the country is well placed to be a global player in this game-changing technology.</p>
<p>Cellular agriculture uses biotechnology to create animal-derived products like meat, milk, eggs and leather from cells – rather than whole animals. It is an emerging global industry, with more than 90 companies founded worldwide since 2015. The first cultivated meat product was approved for sale in Singapore in 2020, and US$1.2 billion was invested in cultivated foods globally in 2021.</p>
<p>CAA’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr Sam Perkins, said while it is a nascent industry in Australia, it was well-placed to become a world leader. “With a world-leading agricultural sector, an outstanding stem cell research industry, and growing advanced manufacturing infrastructure, Australia can become a global leader in cellular agriculture.”</p>
<p>In addition, cellular agriculture has the potential to address a number of Australia’s policy objectives, including enhancing food security using fewer natural resources and strengthening resilience to a changing climate. The technology and emerging industry is capturing increasing attention, from policymakers through to fund managers with a focus on responsible investing. Hunter Page, Impact Investment Specialist and Portfolio Manager at Sydney-based listed equities fund manager, Redpoint, says innovation in the global food industry is critical to driving the transition to net-zero.</p>
<p>“Cellular agriculture is emerging as a viable technology with enormous potential benefits for nature and the climate while the world seeks ways to feed everyone. Decarbonisation and the safeguarding of nature is won and lost in the most energy and natural capital intensive sectors. Cellular agriculture is an exciting opportunity for investors to fund the solutions and participate in the growth of a nascent industry.”</p>
<p>Cellular Agriculture Australia is calling for three initiatives in public investment and infrastructure development to capture this economic opportunity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing a skilled and future-fit workforce to enable commercialisation and industry growth</li>
<li>Deepening Australia’s cross-disciplinary open access cellular agriculture research</li>
<li>Establishing at-scale manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>“National strategic coordination and targeted public investment are needed to propel a new advanced manufacturing opportunity in Australia,” says Dr Perkins.” To strengthen our ambitions in advanced food and beverage manufacturing - and enhance our existing agriculture and biotechnology industries, swift action must be taken.”</p>
<p>Tom Davies, VP of Research and Operations (APAC) for Change Foods, a Australian-US company developing precision fermented cheese, says access to talent remains a critical limit on growth.</p>
<p>""The future growth and success of the cellular agriculture industry is almost entirely dependent on the work of brilliant scientists, bio-chemists and engineers working together to solve complex problems. Our industry's biggest challenge is not only recruiting and training the people we desperately need now, but how do we build and scale the pipeline to produce the many thousand workers that we require globally in the coming decades?""</p>
<p>Beyond talent, Dr Perkins says access to infrastructure is also hampering the sector’s growth and warns that other countries are already seeking to attract cellular agriculture companies, including from Australia.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a particular interest from the Middle East in growing high tech jobs in the region and countries are offering a range of benefits to attract researchers and startups, including access to world-class infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Paul Bevan, CEO of Melbourne-based company, Magic Valley, the world’s first cultured lamb company, summarises the challenge for Australia.</p>
<p>""Without further investment in domestic infrastructure, we will be forced to set up production overseas where the opportunities are endless"".</p>
<p>Cellular Agriculture Australia is convening a workshop next month to bring together industry, researchers, capital investors and policymakers to develop a shared plan for the industry’s growth.</p>

<p>Duplaco B.V. defaulted in June 2022 leaving one of Europe’s most modern microalgae production facilities behind. The facility, including IP and customer stock, was purchased by Aliga Microalgae who is specialising in cultivating, producing and commercialising algae ingredients. The purchase is a part of Aliga’s scaling strategy to increase the company’s production capacity and secure the supply-chain of its proprietary white Chlorella ingredient, which will enable the company to meet the growing demands from manufactures of animal-free, plant-based and analogue food products globally. Additionally, the purchase will strengthen Aliga’s position as one of the leading producers of high-quality Chlorella algae products for the European dietary supplement markets.</p>
<p><strong>The Product</strong></p>
<p>In July 2022 Aliga Microalgae is introduced its proprietary white Chlorella algae ingredient to European markets - a sustainable complement to soy and pea which can be applied in a broad variety of analogue and hybrid food formulations. As an addition to its green Chlorella offering, Aliga's white Chlorella is a chlorophyll-free, white ingredient with neutral taste and flavour. The ingredient is animal-free, plant-based, allergen-free and protein-rich making it highly applicable in a broad variety of formulations, from meat &amp; seafood analogues and hybrids to savoury-, bakery- and plant-based dairy products. This innovative ingredient is a non-GMO superfood that only consists of fermented and dried Chlorella algae which naturally contains vitamins, minerals, fibres, proteins, amino- and fatty acids. Its improved organoleptic properties enables application in formulations that previously has not been possible due green Chlorella’s natural high content of chlorophyll and strong algae flavour.</p>

While the vast majority of cultivated meat companies focus on making sausages or burgers, producing meat that mimics conventional meat cuts is currently extremely difficult — only a handful of companies in the world have been able to showcase pork or beef structured prototypes. Novel Farms now joins this select group by creating a cultivated pork loin that displays the marbling and texture of a real muscle cut.</p>
<p>Novel Farms solves the structuring problem by developing a proprietary microbial fermentation approach to produce low-cost, edible, and highly customizable scaffolds. Their tissue development platform gives them an important and unique advantage by not only providing them with the capability to structure meat from any animal species but also doing it in a very cost-effective way. While scaffolding biomaterials such as alginate need to undergo costly functionalization to ensure effective cell attachment, their scaffolding process completely bypasses this step, reducing production costs by 99.27% and thus accelerating the path to the commercialization of their products at price parity. </p>
<p>The founder team, Nieves Martinez Marshall, PhD, and Michelle Lu, PhD, met while working as postdoctoral scientists in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at the University of California at Berkeley prior to launching the company in 2020. Their combined experience of over 30 years in research was key in the ideation of an elegant and unique structuring approach for producing cultivated meat, which has been awarded a highly competitive grant from the National Science Foundation through the <a href=""https://www.sbir.gov/node/2083261""><em>Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</em> Program (phase I)</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to accelerate the widespread adoption of cultivated meat and its benefits by producing ‘hard-to-resist’ whole muscle cuts,” said Nieves Martinez Marshall. “Therefore, we need to be able to fulfill consumer demand by delivering cultivated meat with the same fibrous texture and mouthfeel as conventional cuts from an animal.”</p>
<p>Novel Farms has raised US$1.4 million in a pre-seed round with participation of Big Idea Ventures, Joyance, Social Starts, Sustainable Food Ventures, Good Startup, CULT foods and strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>""We have worked with Novel Farms from their earliest days and are excited about what they have accomplished in the cultivated meat category. They have always tackled the scale-up challenges with fresh and novel approaches and Big Idea Ventures is glad to support them throughout their journey as true innovation leaders. Novel Farms are ones to watch, support and partner with as they bring sustainable protein to the world market, said Andrew D. Ive, Managing General Partner for Big Idea Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>About Novel Farms</strong></p>
<p>Novel Farms is dedicated to craft whole cuts of cultivated meat delicacies and bring culinary excellence and sustainability into the future of food. By cultivating meat from conventional as well as highly prized animal breeds, they seek to captivate the palates of all meat lovers while satisfying environmentally-conscious eaters.</p>

The course is specially designed for students and industry professionals, to equip them with the foundational knowledge to understand this emerging industry and its future potential. Knowledge gained through the course will act as a baseline for practical educational experiences, which is critical for future graduates to translate theory into the creation of impactful outcomes for the sector.</p>
<p>The online course is the first of its kind in Australia, and was developed in response from conversations with industry and academia, who state that one of the biggest challenges the industry faces in order to grow the sector and achieve commercial scale is the ability to access and attract new talent. Globally, there is a growing risk of a talent shortage, with predictions that more than <a href=""https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work"">85 million jobs could go unfilled</a> by 2030 due to the absence of skilled people to take them. Since the cellular agriculture industry is still nascent, its future potential may be hindered if initiatives to solve this problem are not explored and actioned. This was the main driver for this initiative and CAA hopes it will act as a catalyst for further dedicated courses that deepen knowledge and build industry relevant skills for the sector.</p>
<p>The six modules consist of an introduction to cellular agriculture, an opportunity for Australia, an introduction to cultivated meat production, an introduction to precision fermentation, scaling cellular agriculture, and food policy and regulation in Australia.</p>
<p>Students and industry professionals transitioning from other fields were identified to be the key audience of the course which if successful, could serve as a case study for universities to develop their own internal subjects or courses on cellular agriculture, or could serve as part of an employee's training at a cellular agriculture company. </p>
<p>Christina Aguila, the University Innovation Specialist at GFI, said, ""Cellular Agriculture Australia's short course is huge for the future food movement. To feed nearly 10 billion people by 2050, we need to prepare a massive wave of talent to enter the cellular agriculture space.</p>
<p>Like any emerging field, we're facing a lack of formal educational programs focused on cell ag and alternative proteins. It can take years for universities to establish new courses and majors, so online short courses like this are critical. Rather than wait for formal programs to become commonplace at universities, CAA is giving learners an opportunity to kickstart their educational journey into the alt protein field right away.</p>
<p>Developing a robust alt protein workforce will require people from all walks of life and parts of the world—not just students on the traditional college path. This type of free, web-based offering is an important step toward building the workforce required to feed the world in a better way.""</p>
<p>Although the world has transitioned to online learning, not all content has been designed to deliver strong education outcomes. As such, and through a collaborative approach, CAA intends to bring together subject matter experts in all facets of cellular agriculture and learning and development experts to create an accessible global learning hub for cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>Dr. Sam Perkins, CEO of Cellular Agriculture Australia, says that, “When online learning content is purposefully designed to create engaging experiences and strong education outcomes it can act as a scalable tool to support further practical and applied skill development, which will be essential for the future of our sector.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://cellularagricultureaustralia.org/"">Cellular Agriculture Australia</a> is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to accelerating the cellular agriculture sector in Australia. Their initiatives are focused on developing talent pipelines into cellular agriculture, creating a connected and collaborative community within the sector, and promoting positive awareness of cellular agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>Germany’s leading biotech startup Mushlabs will be working together with Bitburger Brewery Group, one of the most significant private brewery groups in Germany. Bitburger aims to provide capacity as well as byproducts from beer production as raw materials. Mushlabs intends to valorize and use these local by-products to cultivate edible mushroom mycelium in a highly efficient fermentation process. The mycelium will be used to produce nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods. With this unique collaboration, the two companies aim to demonstrate a possible solution to the waste of resources and thus make a contribution to the circular economy in Europe.</strong></p>

<p>Hamburg, July 13, 2022. Bitburger Ventures, the venture investment arm of the Bitburger Group of Companies, invested in Mushlabs in 2019. Now the companies are launching their strategic collaboration, with the goal of rapidly developing innovative production processes that could save millions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Utilizing high-value byproducts from the local agri-food industry, and thus returning valuable nutrients to the food economy, are integral parts of Mushlabs’ strategy. The startup is one of the first biotech companies in the world to use byproducts for the fermentation of edible mushroom mycelium. In the future, the raw materials will be sourced locally and the food produced on site — in each case adapted to the individual conditions and needs of the market. This efficient use of resources makes fermentation one of the most sustainable methods of producing alternative proteins worldwide. The Bitburger Brewery Group has been working intensively on sustainability issues along the value chain for years and already recycles its residual materials to the agricultural sector. In cooperation with Mushlabs, these residual materials will be used for mycelial fermentation, among other things, in order to reduce transport distances and further improve the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint.</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Dr. Thibault Godard, CSO at Mushlabs:</strong><br />
“Mushlab’s technology is able to address the sustainability and supply security issues plaguing our current food system. We can utilize the full potential of natural resources by recovering the nutrients from valuable industrial food leftovers and reinjecting them back into local food economies. In doing so, we show that it is possible to simultaneously increase the efficiency, profitability, and sustainability of historical food production systems.</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Jan Niewodniczanski, Managing Director Technology and Environment at Bitburger Brewery Group:</strong><br />
“We are always looking for ways to improve the sustainability of our production process and to explore new, innovative paths. This has been part of Bitburger’s DNA for 200 years.”</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Dr. Friedrich Droste, Managing Director of Bitburger Ventures:</strong><br />
“Mushlabs is an excellent example of how we understand our role as Bitburger Ventures in the group of companies — through the interaction between the fermentation know-how of Mushlabs and the technical brewing know-how in the Bitburger Brewery Group, we can offer real added value. Using by-products and existing infrastructure from the brewing process to produce alternative proteins in the brewery environment is no longer a future fantasy with this cooperation, but lived practice that creates sustainable value for all parties involved and the environment.”</p>

<p><strong>Hamburg-based biotech startup Mushlabs has been selected for the EU's prestigious EIC Accelerator program. More than 1,000 startups and small businesses from Europe applied to receive a share of the €382 million in total capital. 74 outstanding companies will now each receive funding of up to 17.5 million Euros - with Mushlabs receiving an eight-digit figure. Through the EIC Accelerator program, the EU aims to support technology startups that address societal challenges and drive breakthrough European innovations. This year, five companies from the food sector are represented. For CEO and founder, Dr. Mazen Rizk, Mushlabs’ selection is a clear sign that Europe is focusing on ensuring a safe and sustainable food supply.</strong></p>
<p>Hamburg, June 13, 2022 - German company Mushlabs is harnessing the power of biotechnology to develop a new generation of sustainable food. The production process is unique: instead of cultivating a mushroom fruiting body, the mycelium (the root of the mushroom) is grown in a highly efficient and time-saving process called fermentation. The resulting ingredient serves as a new staple food and, thanks to its outstanding properties, can be transformed into almost any food product with little effort. At the same time, it has a significantly smaller ecological footprint than soy or meat. Mushlabs' vision is to create a sustainable, healthy and fair food system - made in Europe.</p>
<p>Established in 2021 by the European Commission, the European Innovation Council (EIC) is Europe's flagship innovation program to identify, develop and disseminate breakthrough innovations across all technology sectors, particularly the health, environment, and digital sectors. Startups and small and medium-sized enterprises are supported by the program, with only the most innovative companies selected through the competitive and rigorous selection process by external experts, investors, and entrepreneurs. In 2021, the first year of the EIC Accelerator program, only 4% of projects were awarded funding. Decisive criteria for selection are the provision of an innovative and strategically relevant technology for Europe, a contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, excellent scale-up potential, and a well-thought-out commercialization strategy. As part of the EIC community, the selected companies will receive capital as well as mentoring and access to investors and companies.</p>
<p><strong>Quote Dr. Mazen Rizk, CEO and Founder of Mushlabs:</strong><br />
“Our selection for the EIC Accelerator Program shows that the EU is seriously addressing the sustainability and security issues in the food sector. The looming food crisis and the ongoing devastating effects on the environment make it abundantly clear how fragile our current system is. Mushlabs uses biotechnology to tap into the full nutritional potential of mycelium, the root of mushrooms. Using fermentation, we cultivate a new staple food that has the potential to feed the world. New technologies like this make it possible to build a fairer, decentralized, and sustainable food system. We want to lead this revolution in Europe and take it into the world. Support programs such as the EIC Accelerator strengthen Europe as an innovation site and secure promising technologies for its own markets. To become even more competitive, the EU can and must do more - for example, in accelerating regulatory and approval processes. Here we are already behind other competitor regions.""</p>
<p><strong>Comment from the EIC Jury:</strong><br />
“The jury believes that the European Union needs to support companies with unique and strategic technology to produce sustainable alternative protein based on a circular model. This is a break-through technology born in Europe that can impact the alternatives to the animal protein market with clean and less processed final food products. The project is addressing several SDGs with positive impact on land, water and energy usage. The team is business savvy, ambitious, adapts quickly, coachable and has complimentary skills needed to implement the technology and the scale-up.”</p>

<p>REHOVOT, Israel – June 13, 2022 – <a href=""https://wilkismilk.com/"">Wilk</a> (TASE: WILK), a developer of authentic, cell-based human and animal milk and milk components, today announced it was able to successfully produce the breast milk protein, lactoferrin, in internal testing in its laboratories. This makes Wilk one of the first bio-FoodTech companies to advance the production of cell-cultured human milk.</p>

<p>Lactoferrin, a key protein in human breast milk, can be found in concentrations <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2011/12000/Bovine_Lactoferrin_Can_Be_Taken_Up_by_the_Human.8.aspx"">up to 50 times higher than bovine milk</a>, is the major protein responsible for providing iron and other key nutrients to nursing infants and is essential to supporting the growth and development of newborns. Incorporating human <a>lactoferrin</a> proteins into infant formula can result in a product that is considerably closer to real breast milk than the cow and plant-based substitutes currently available on the market.</p>

<p>“This breakthrough brings us one step closer to our goal of providing all infants with the full range of nutritional benefits that can only be found in breast milk,” said Tomer Aizen CEO of Wilk. “This is significant news for both the infant formula industry and parents who may soon have access to the optimal product for ensuring their infants’ growth and development.”</p>

<p>In addition to its benefits for infant nutrition, lactoferrin has displayed significant potential in addressing a range of other health issues, with studies showing its preventive and therapeutic benefits for conditions including coronary heart disease and even <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01221/full#:~:text=10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.01221-,The%20Biology%20of%20Lactoferrin%2C%20an%20Iron%2DBinding%20Protein%20That%20Can,Defend%20Against%20Viruses%20and%20Bacteria&amp;text=Lactoferrin%20is%20a%20nutrient%20classically,%2C%20bile%2C%20and%20cerebrospinal%20fluid."">coronavirus</a>. Recent trials have also reported that lactoferrin can bind to some of the receptors through which the coronavirus attacks cells in the digestive and respiratory system, thus potentially preventing infection.</p>

<p>Wilk estimates that further development will enable the production of human lactoferrin in unlimited amounts, thus facilitating the long-term sustainable production of such proteins independent of animal or human sources.</p>

<p><strong>About Wilk </strong> </p>

<p>Wilk operates at the crossroads of Biotech and FoodTech, developing technologies for producing cultured human breast and animal milk. Having launched operations in 2020, the company holds patents on laboratory production processes that replicate the milk-producing cells of humans and other mammals to create 100% real milk and milk components in laboratory settings.

<hr />
<p><em>By Clair Purcell, Newlab’s Chief Venture Builder </em></p>

<p>Like many adventures, it started as a conversation between strangers at the back of a bus.</p>

<p>I was at the <a href=""https://ginkgoferment.com/"">Ferment Conference</a> heading to check out Ginkgo Bioworks foundry, speaking to Bre, the Research Operations and Outreach Director from <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/"">New Harvest</a>, which I’d later discover is the leading field building organization for cellular agriculture.</p>

<p><em>‘There’s not enough B2B businesses in cellular agriculture. Everyone wants to be the one making the chicken nuggets…’</em></p>

<p>My ears perked up. One week into my new role as Chief Venture Builder at Newlab, I was working out how to scale Newlab’s new business-building capabilities, particularly ones that will have a positive impact on planetary health. What I love about <em>intentional</em> business-building is that there are so many impactful opportunities that aren’t noticed by entrepreneurs because they’re not as trendy or visible as… chicken nuggets.</p>

<p><strong>The time is right to build infrastructure businesses to scale cellular agriculture. </strong></p>

<p>It was the start of a deep dive into the space of growing animal products without the animal–otherwise known as lab-grown or post-animal production: real beef and leather without killing a cow and real milk without milking one. It’s a wonderful, hugely impactful, and extremely complex industry that has the potential to eliminate <a href=""http://gfi.org/climate"">10-14 gigatonnes of carbon emissions per year</a>, eradicate animal abuse, and deliver nutritious, high-quality <a href=""https://www.bluenalu.com/"">meats</a>, <a href=""https://recruit.galy.co/"">clothing</a>, and <a href=""https://www.melibio.com/"">ingredients</a> to humans in a sustainable way.</p>

<p>The cellular agriculture industry is on the cusp of mainstream adoption:</p>

<ol>
	<li><u>The science is shifting from proof of possibility to a focus on cost reduction.</u> Inventors in this space have come a long way from the first lab-grown burger, which cost a whopping $400k. Even if you’re a skeptic on the claims of today’s companies making it for ~$7/kg (or ~$1.50/burger), the downward trend line is clear. Large infrastructure companies focused on delivering single pieces of the puzzle at scale for multiple customers will further push these techno-economics downward.</li>
	<li><u>Around the corner from cost reduction is scale.</u> <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan"">Today’s businesses will need to scale at 70% per year, every year for the next 10 years just to capture 1% of the global meat market</a>. Early entrants by necessity are vertically integrated. New entrants need an ecosystem that helps them focus on their unique value proposition, not reinvent the wheel on the infrastructure needed to do so.</li>
	<li><u>Only </u><a href=""https://admin-21183.medium.com/state-of-the-industry-8b4f5e2826b4"">40%</a><u> of the companies in the field today are B2B businesses</u>. For capital-intensive industries like hardware and biotech, this is usually closer to 80-90%. B2B businesses have a lot of catching up to do to enable the level of scale needed.</li>
	<li><u>Regulatory approval is on the (far?) horizon</u>. Singapore was the first country in the world to regulate serving lab-grown meat, with <a href=""https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-regulation-2021/"">many others tipped to follow</a>. This includes the U.S., who has partnered with the FDA and USDA to work through how to regulate.</li>
	<li><u>Growth in investments has increased dramatically ($1.3BN in 2021, up 336% from 2019)</u>. This indicates a broader recognition by the investment community of the dynamics discussed above and potentially smoother pathways to raising capital for large infrastructure projects.</li>
	<li><u>Reinvention of the way we make animal products has only just begun.</u> We’re only just beginning to explore the areas where the cellular agriculture approach could be applied. A single application could upend an entire industry (e.g. <a href=""https://www.c16bio.com/"">palm oil</a>, <a href=""https://www.biomilq.com/"">baby formula</a>, and commodity foods like <a href=""https://www.cacultured.com/"">chocolate</a>). If  the natural resources and ethical constraints around certain foods are removed, we might see an uptick in the diversity of food options (<a href=""https://www.primevalfoods.co/revolution"">lion steaks or tiger tacos</a> anyone?).</li>
</ol>

<p>Thousands of businesses need to be, and will be, built in this space over the next decade.</p>

<p>For that to become a reality, B2B businesses that make it easy to build new CellAg products will be fundamental.</p>

<p>Over the past month, we’ve explored where B2B businesses will be most impactful in reducing today’s cost of beef per kilo, from <a href=""https://cedelft.eu/publications/tea-of-cultivated-meat/"">~$22,000/kg</a> down to something cost competitive. We believe there are four key focus areas:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Optimizing bioprocessing <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> production systems.</strong> Creating proteins through cell culturing and precision fermentation is fraught with costly and inefficient processes that will be challenging to scale. We’re exploring how this can be improved by examining closed-loop systems, decentralized production facilities, and improving hardware infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Software and toolkits that enable simplicity in bioprocesses.</strong> Most companies develop their own software and toolkits out of necessity to effectively operate their bioprocess equipment. Building out standardized and simplified software toolkits will enable production cost reductions, the output of better data, and automation within a given bioprocess flow.</li>
	<li><strong>Alternative manufacturing for proteins and inputs.</strong> The majority of cell ag production processes involve cell culturing or precision fermentation. This opportunity area explores alternative manufacturing methods, such as molecular farming, yeast, and microalgae, and examines opportunities with cutting-edge technologies around 3D printing and scaffolds to create proteins and inputs more cost-efficiently.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform technologies for optimized ingredient discovery.</strong> The ‘holy grail’ of synthetic biology is to develop platform technologies that make the production of high-quality materials faster, cheaper, and more sustainable. This opportunity area investigates whether functional edible and non-edible proteins can be developed through platform technologies that can lend to applications within, and outside, cellular agriculture.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Big businesses need a strong ecosystem to be successful.</strong></p>

<p>Venture Studios are powerful mechanisms for growing businesses that can impact entire ecosystems. This is because they:</p>

<ol>
	<li><u>Build the businesses that need to be built</u>. What is most impactful is often not the most visible, hyped, or attractive. Venture studios start from a market need and develop concepts in response to that need.</li>
	<li><u>Derisk concepts early</u>. Often, lone founders can spend months or years working on a concept only to discover that it doesn’t work. Our venture building approach (a mix of lean, design, and agile methodologies with our own sprinkle of deep tech learnings) and access to industry pilot partners and experts means we learn early and cheaply what will be successful. We make fewer mistakes and move faster towards the right solution.</li>
	<li><u>Scale quickly</u>. An early-stage startup needs to focus on two things: product validation and market fit. Newlab provides the mental and physical space to focus on what matters most in the crucial first 18 months of a new company’s life. Operations, recruitment, funding, branding–these are all things the Newlab team has been doing for years for our own company and the startups we support. Newlab’s Brooklyn location has a brand new BioLab and we are actively exploring building out biotechnology-specific infrastructure in 2023.</li>
	<li><u>Build the dream team from the ground up.</u> From the selection of Founders-in-Residence to headhunting CEOs or acting as the founding team ourselves, we build curated teams of people who are passionate, talented, and have the experience to scale up, not just start up. We‘re also proud to provide stipends and early funding to ensure that working on an early-stage startup is an accessible option to people from all walks of life, resulting in more diverse, successful teams.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this amounts to better chances of success; businesses built by Venture Studios are more likely to get to Series A, and we get there twice as fast (2 year vs 4 years). </p>

<p><strong>Founders who work with venture studios are more likely to be successful and expend less stress and wasted effort along the way.</strong></p>

<p>For an opportunity as large as scaling cellular agriculture, the first step is to partner with people who bring other pieces of the puzzle that are complementary to our own.</p>

<p>We’ve started with <a href=""https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lejjygafour"">Lejjy</a> from CULT Food Sciences. The former CEO and founder of a YC-backed B2B Cellular Agriculture business, Future Fields, and now CEO of one of the most forward thinking VC companies we’ve ever had the pleasure of working with, CULT is already building out a number of initiatives to scale the cellular agriculture industry (including <a href=""http://opencellag.com"">The Cellular Agriculture Network of Excellence</a>, <a href=""https://www.cultfoodscience.com/cell-x"">their own Research</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.cultfoodscience.com/press-releases/cult-food-science-secures-space-for-the-development-of-an-incubation-studio-in-ontario"">physical space in Canada</a>).</p>

<p><em>“</em><em>The venture studio provides a unique model that fits well with the overall strategy of CULT Food Science — it provides an avenue for new ideas and IP to be developed from the ground up with skilled experts and an eye for really pushing the boundaries of what has been done to date with cellular agriculture. Between CULT Food Science and Newlab, we will be a driving force for new innovations in the industry over the next few years” — Lejjy Gafour, CEO of CULT Food Science. </em></p>

<p><strong>Our next step is… you? </strong></p>

<p>We’re seeking people who fit a broader vision of who a founder can be: a scientist, an inventor, or an operator, interested in building in a highly collaborative environment.</p>

<p>Up to three people will have the opportunity to receive a monthly stipend and work together with our Director of Venture Strategy, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-khogali/"">Abdul</a>, over three to five months to identify, validate, and prioritize businesses in the opportunity areas outlined earlier. The top business/es will receive funding and support from Newlab and CULT to launch and grow to the next stage of funding. You’ll be a part of the Newlab Community in Brooklyn with full use of our biolab as well as access to Newlab and CULT experts and mentors.</p>

<p>We envision someone who:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Has a background in biotechnology or life sciences</li>
	<li>If an inventor, they have a potential technology that they’d like to see commercialized</li>
	<li>Has a strong point of view of what’s missing from the market and a vision for its economic viability</li>
	<li>Believes that impactful solutions are strong investments</li>
	<li>Prioritizes helping people at scale over one narrow focus</li>
</ul>

The company achieved this round after completing Eatable Adventures' acceleration program, one of the top three global accelerators for food tech startups.</p>
<p>The round was led by Big Idea Ventures, the global alternative protein fund, the U.S. multinational Cargill Ventures, the Spanish accelerator Eatable Adventures and Tech Transfer UPV. With a capital injection of this size, the startup can scale its business model and expand into other international markets, enabling them to utilize their disruptive 3D bioprinting and robotics technologies to create more sustainable and nutritious food products.</p>
<p>Patxi Larumbe, CEO and founder of Cocuus states <em>""We are very proud to have attracted the interest of international investors with this round of financing. Thanks to this capital injection we will be able to bring our technology within reach of corporations that want to print proteins on an industrial scale""</em>. In addition, the Founder and Managing General Partner of Big Idea Ventures, Andrew D Ive, also highlights “<em>At Big Idea Ventures, we invest in technology which impacts the alternative protein industry’s entire value chain. Cocuus’ technology addresses a major pain point of structured plant- and cell-based meat production methods: scalability. We are thrilled to support this innovative team and we look forward to seeing their scalable food technology making an impact across the world.""</em> </p>

Brevel uses non-GMO microalgae grown in a unique breakthrough technology which enables the highest quality of sustainable protein production at cost levels comparable to pea and soy, the leading sources of plant based protein today. </p>
<p>The current alternative protein market has many problems when it comes to cost, flavor, functionality, quality and sustainability. Microalgae are the ultimate source of protein in terms of sustainability, but unfortunately the existing options for microalgae as an alternative protein have very high costs and flavor barriers. Brevel’s solution for microalgae-based protein has managed to solve these challenges.</p>
<p>Brevel’s technology is the first globally to combine sugar-based fermentation of microalgae with a high concentration of light at industrial scales. The result is a protein that will be price competitive with pea and soy and is color and flavor neutral. Brevel’s protein solves immediate challenges in plant-based dairy and egg products that lack a valuable nutritional profile due to the need for very mildly flavored protein sources. Due to the high nutritional values and sustainable production in the mid and long terms, Brevel is aiming to become the #1 choice for plant-based protein worldwide.</p>
<p>“For the first time Brevel will be providing a truly sustainable solution which is not only tasty and blends perfectly into different food applications to increase their nutritional value, but is also at an affordable cost which puts it on the path for global-scale mainstream adoption.” said Yonatan Golan, CEO and Co-Founder of Brevel. “As early as Q4 2022, Brevel’s first commercial factory will provide a solution that the food industry has been waiting for for too long”. </p>
<p>""Seeing Brevel's achievements over the last few years, we are convinced that Brevel not only has great product-market fit, but that they have what it takes to become a market leader,” said Arman Anaturk, CEO and Co-Founder of FoodHack. “Brevel's scalable solution has the potential to help millions of people around the world eat dairy-free products that have excellent nutritional values at the right price. Our decision to invest in Brevel is an easy one and we are pleased to support Yonatan and his team on the journey.""</p>
<p>Brevel’s technology is based on high-tech indoor, sterile and fully automated systems which are illuminated from within at high intensity. The unique process enables the production of microalgae at a cost reduction of more than 90% and includes nutrient rich ingredients and functionalities that are only produced in the presence of light. Now with the closing of their Seed funding round, conditions are finally ripe for the next stage of mass production.</p>
<p><strong>About Brevel</strong></p>
<p>Brevel is providing microalgae based alternative protein which is affordable, flavor and color neutral, highly functional, sustainable and at consistent and scalable production. Thanks to Brevel’s unique proprietary technology breakthrough the future of nutrition will be sustainable at global scales.</p>

<p><strong>About CELLAMENT™</strong><br />
IntegriCulture has developed the CulNet™ system, which produces growth factors and serum components that account for a large part of the cost of producing cultured meat. The culture supernatant obtained from this system includes various useful components necessary for culturing target cells (e.g., muscle cells and liver cells).</p>
<p>Since it was confirmed that the culture supernatant of chicken egg embryo extraembryonic membrane conditioned cells obtained at the development stage of this CulNet™ system is also useful for human skin[4], we have considered the stability as a cosmetic raw material. It was launched our original cosmetic ingredient CELLAMENT™, which designed to repair and rejuvenate the skin in April 2021.

<p><strong>About IntegriCulture Inc.</strong><br />
We aim to use our proprietary low-cost cell culture technology CulNet™ system as a new platform in the biotechnology field, and to use it in various fields such as foods and leather made up of animal cells. The CulNet™ system is a versatile cell culture platform technology that simulates the interaction between organs in animals (patented). Theoretically, this technology can cultivate all animal cells on a large scale and at low cost and is expected to be used for various purposes including cultured meat. At the lab scale, we have already achieved the production of serum components, which contributed to the high cost. By realizing in-house production of serum components, it is not necessary to use fetal bovine serum and growth factors, which are the main causes of high cost of conventional cell culture, and the cost of cell culture can be significantly reduced.

The recent announcement comes just days before CEO and Co-Founder, Patricia Bubner, PhD, will present in Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) is holding its annual meeting. Bubner will share how they plan to democratize access to delicious and healthful cell-cultured meat to help address food insecurity.</p>
<p>Orbillion splashed on the scene with their first public tasting in which they showcased 3 different delicious meats (pre-regulatory approval). The real kicker? It was after only four months of development, proving that the team at Orbillion has the requisite technical expertise and can move fast, in fact 18x faster and 10x cheaper than other cell-cultured meat companies.</p>
<p>Since graduating from the esteemed accelerator YCombinator in 2021, Orbillion has continued to expand its leadership team and advisory board. Most recently Orbillion welcomed Greg Hiller, a globally recognized industry leader in cell culture and bioprocessing innovation, as an Advisor.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to join the Orbillion team as an Advisor to help push the frontier of what’s possible for cultured meat. I’m hopeful that my skill set of innovative process development methods will further facilitate the development of a highly intensified cell culture process that will make cultured meat scalable, and as a result, accessible to all,” shared Hiller.</p>
<p>To date the Orbillion team has raised $9.5 million to blend breakthrough science, heritage breeds, and culinary artistry; their first product will be cell-cultured, Japanese bred, Wagyu beef.</p>
<p>“I believe that the future of food will involve making delicious food more sustainable and more accessible. The Orbillion team of culinary innovators has the technical chops to deliver on the promise of cell-cultured meat, and to create high-quality products that eaters will love.” said Orbillion Investor and Instacart CEO, Fidji Simo.</p>
<p>As Orbillion turns its sights to launching a product in the market, pending regulatory approvals, access is top of mind. With food prices and food security straining under geopolitical issues and a changing climate, consumers and farmers will only continue to bear the burden. Given the urgency and scale of these issues, Orbillion believes all solutions must be on the table.</p>
<p>“We are advocates of a wide range of solutions that can help make our food system more sustainable, nutritious, and reliable, and we see cell-cultured meat and alt proteins as an important ""and"" solution to regenerative agriculture. We all must work together,” said Bubner. “Realizing the potential of cell-cultured meat means making it accessible. We know from extensive consumer and foodservice research around the globe, that price is key to making that happen. I’m so proud of the team that in less than one year, we’ve reduced the cost of production by 98%. Very eager for what’s ahead.”</p>
<p>Bubner and her Co-Founders, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS, and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD, were invited to present in Davos during this year’s WEF annual meeting. Bubner will speak at the Green Accelerator event and Orbillion will attend several other events with government officials and industry leaders, to discuss how cell-cultured meat can support food independence.</p>
<p><strong>About Orbillion:</strong><br />
<a href=""https://www.orbillion.com/"">Orbillion Bio</a> will be the first company to bring cell-cultured beef to market.

- The tool lists key research ‘Problems to Solve’ in the field and matches these to related tertiary qualifications  - ‘Majors’ - available in Australia, with direct links to Australian universities that can be filtered by State
- The new version includes non-STEM ‘Problems to Solve’, encompassing public perception, policy and regulation, funding and investment, transition research, and commerce 
- Cellular Agriculture Australia is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to accelerating the cellular agriculture sector in Australia. Their goals are to develop talent pipelines into cellular agriculture, create a connected and collaborative community within the sector, and promote positive awareness of cellular agriculture","<p>Cellular Agriculture Australia (CAA) has updated their interactive tool ‘Pathways into Cellular Agriculture’ with the addition of non-STEM ‘Problems to Solve’. ‘Pathways’ is an initiative from CAA designed to drive more talent into cellular agriculture, an emerging industry and research field dedicated to producing animal products (such as meat, seafood, eggs, dairy, and leather) using cells rather than animals.</p>
<p>CAA initially developed ‘Pathways’ to assist students and job seekers in mapping technical STEM career pathways within areas of cellular agriculture research. But with the field rapidly growing, the focus has expanded to include the social, economic, cultural, and political dimensions of cellular agriculture that must be addressed if the industry is going to realise its potential once regulatory approval has been granted. </p>
<p>Version 2 incorporates current non-STEM research focus areas alongside those existing for STEM, creating a multidisciplinary tool that is reflective of the emerging needs of the industry and the diversity of talent needed to enter and power the field. Drawing on a range of existing publications and developed in consultation with research and industry experts, the initial non-STEM areas include public perception, policy and regulation, funding and investment, transition research, and commerce. The tool’s target user groups are high school and university students, graduates, and professionals who are curious about a career in cellular agriculture and want to explore current research focus areas.</p>
<p>“Students want to know what sorts of roles are out there, and what skills and knowledge will qualify them to be employed and to succeed in those roles,'' says Founder of CAA, Dr Bianca Le.</p>
<p>“Increasingly, professionals in adjacent industries are also reaching out to us to learn how they can apply their existing expertise to forge a new career pathway into cellular agriculture.” </p>
<p>Dr. Sam Perkins, CAA’s incoming CEO, adds, “The ‘Pathways’ tool acts as a bridge for people who are inspired to play a part in advancing cellular agriculture but are unsure where to begin. The tool highlights the wonderfully diverse range of talent opportunities available to passionate individuals looking to make a difference in our food system.”</p>
<p>The update comes at a timely stage in the development of the industry. There are currently over <a href=""https://gfi.org/resource/alternative-protein-company-database/""><u>100 startups</u></a> in the space globally, with some companies opening the first of various pilot production facilities for cellular agriculture products. Governments around the world including the Dutch, Israeli and United States are starting to invest in the development of the technology,  and begin mapping a path towards regulatory approval and commercialisation. Here in Australia, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) <a href=""https://futurealternative.com.au/cultivated-meat-could-be-on-australian-shelves-next-year/""><u>anticipates an application from a cultivated meat company</u></a> in the next few weeks, meaning we could see cultivated meat on Australian shelves next year. </p>
<p>""Cellular agriculture has made incredible technology gains recently, but could still falter if we don't consider the social, economic, and political contexts. We need to start working on the social opportunities and consequences of cellular agriculture to ensure its success beyond the lab."" Says Dr. Adam Cardilini, a lecturer in Environmental Sciences at Deakin University.</p>
<p>The ‘Pathways’ tool was based on a range of existing resources in the cellular agriculture field, and designed to be used as a comprehensive and cohesive resource to help individuals launch their future career in cellular agriculture. Although designed for Australian-based users, this tool could be replicated in many countries. CAA welcomes queries from any interested parties in developing a similar tool.</p>

Since the technology can also be used to produce other animal fats, this could be a real game changer in sustainable food production. In connection with this the company secured a €5 million Series Seed financing round to scale-up production and expand the team.</p>
<p>Melt&amp;Marble’s precision fermentation platform enables it to create customized fats with molecular properties mirroring those of animal fats, allowing for ingredients that deliver the flavor, melt and mouthfeel of real animal fat. Its ingredients will enable a major step forward in erasing the taste gap between conventional animal-based foods and plant-based alternatives.</p>
<p>“While most people accept that we must minimize our consumption of animal-based foods, plant-based alternatives face a big hurdle,” said CEO and Co-Founder Dr. Anastasia Krivoruchko. “The plant-based fats currently used simply do not feel, act and taste like animal-based fats. As a result, the food does not taste as good, making it less attractive to consumers. As far as we’re aware, this is the first beef-like fat prototype produced via precision fermentation. It is a groundbreaking step towards making plant-based meat tastier.”</p>
<p>Melt&amp;Marble’s technology platform was spun out from research work conducted over the past decade by co-founders Dr. Krivoruchko, Dr. Florian David and Professor Jens Nielsen at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. The new funding round will be used to accelerate toward commercialization by expanding R&amp;D efforts, scaling up production, conducting extensive application tests and expanding the team. The company is actively recruiting bioprocess and microbial engineers in addition to a Head of Food Science to grow its food technology team.</p>
<p>The company’s recent round was led by Lever VC, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on innovative technologies and brands in the alternative protein space, with participation from new investors Be8 Ventures and Good Startup and existing investors Nordic Foodtech VC, PINC (Paulig Incubator) and Chalmers Ventures.</p>
<p>“Melt&amp;Marble’s fermentation-derived beef fat will facilitate the step change in product quality that companies in the space have been striving for, increasing the size of their addressable markets and accelerating consumer uptake,” says James Caffyn, Partner at Lever VC. “We have been hugely impressed by the progress Dr. Krivoruchko and her team have made and are excited to support them in their growth.”</p>
<p>Tests conducted on the company’s latest prototype show it displays the gradual melting behavior of beef fat, an important property for achieving slow flavor release and lingering juiciness. “So much is happening in this field, and we are immensely proud to help with the transition towards more environmentally friendly food production,” added Dr. Krivoruchko.</p>

<p><strong>Techstars-backed materials technology company </strong><a href=""https://www.gelatex.com/""><strong>Gelatex</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>is on the mission to make cultured meat available in supermarkets. As a pioneer in making scaffolds for cultured meat, Gelatex has opened a new research, engineering and manufacturing facility to take the development and production of their nanofibrous materials to the next level. Thus, removing one of the barriers in scaling cultured meat. </strong></p>
<p>Gelatex’s scaffolds are produced using patented high-throughput nanofiber technology. The company has increased their production capacity to 5 kg/h while the alternative method of electrospinning produces up to 360 g/h. Gelatex plans to double the volume by the end of the year at their new facility in Tallinn, Estonia. Thus, providing sufficient scaffolds for the manufacturing of 300 000 kg of cultured meat annually.</p>
<p>“Nanofibers have been used for tissue engineering for a long time but until now they have been expensive and difficult to scale. Therefore, no viable solutions are available for cultured meat companies. At Gelatex we solved scalable nanofibers manufacturing because of our own need at first and are now glad to take off the table one challenge that needs to be solved for cultured meat companies. Some cultured meat companies are aiming to have a capacity of around 50-150 tons of meat per year already this or next year. Considering this, Gelatex has sufficient capacity to fulfill the annual scaffold demand for 3-4 first cultured meat companies entering the production level,” comments <strong>CEO of Gelatex, Märt-Erik Martens</strong>. </p>
<p>Gelatex’s production does not need a large manufacturing complex: an industrial machine capable of producing up to 5 kg/h of material occupies less than 10 m2. The new quarters of only 370 m2 have manufacturing, office space, labs (incl. chemistry, materials, and a cell lab) and an equipment development and assembly center all under one roof. In the future, the company wants to have lights-out manufacturing requiring no human presence, as well as using green manufacturing principles.</p>
<p>Considering the small footprint of production and rapid in-house machinery development and manufacturing, the Gelatex team is confident that they can stay ahead of the demand and keep up with the fast growth of the industry. The goal is to make the final meat cost as much or even less than conventional meat today. The company is currently in the process of piloting with the leading cultured meat companies, testing various plant-based ingredients to further optimize the product and assure production and packaging according to the highest safety and cleanliness standards. </p>
<p>According to <strong>Felipe Krelling, founding partner of Lifely VC</strong>, who has invested along Gelatex also in startups such as Cultured Decadence (acquired by Upside Foods), WildType or Jellatech, cost-effective production of cultured meat on a mass scale is a goal for the whole industry. ""While supporting many cultivated meat projects around the world, I’ve seen many breakthroughs in this space in the last years, but scaffolding still remains a challenge both for scalability and costs. That is why we were happy to invest in Gelatex which has a very promising technology to enable the scalability of one very important component in the final cultured meat production,” says Krelling.</p>
<p>Gelatex has patented a novel high-capacity solution-spinning method and device for nanofiber manufacturing to innovate cultured meat, wound care, and many other industries. The material comes in rolls, is easily scalable, up to 90% cheaper and is produced with 28% smaller electricity consumption compared to market alternatives.</p>
<p>Although currently based in Estonia, Gelatex is aiming to have scaffold manufacturing located close to the customer in different parts of the world in the future.</p>
<p><em>Gelatex Technologies is an experienced materials technology company from Estonia and inventor of cost-effective technology for nanofiber production. Their scalable platform technology enables the implementation of nanofibers in applications that were inapproachable until now such as scaffolds for cell-cultured meat, scar-reducing wound care materials, bio-based filtration materials, and more. Gelatex was founded in 2016 and raised €1.2M in 2021.</em></p>",10791

The panel was a collaborative success, with attendees from around 30 organizations1, representing leading cultivated meat companies, ecosystem builders, research institutions, and upstream and downstream partners from both within and outside of China.","<p>The first China Cellular Agriculture Forum discussion panel was held on April 19, Beijing time. The panel was a collaborative success, with attendees from around 30 organizations*, representing leading cultivated meat companies, ecosystem builders, research institutions, and upstream and downstream partners from both within and outside of China.</p>
<p>This Forum was organized with the vision of advocating science-based regulatory policies, facilitating public acceptance of technologies and products related to cellular agriculture, and reaching a consensus on industry-best-practice specifically in the China space. The Forum hopes to unite stakeholders (academia, regulatory authorities, industry groups, etc.) across the field of cellular agriculture to establish a China-focused industry platform, laying the groundwork for future joint efforts in promoting public acceptance in the Chinese market space.</p>
<p>International Food Law expert, Mr. Wilfred Feng, presented a top-level overview of the current regulatory framework in China, stating that ""there are four key regulatory issues to work on, including nomenclature and categorization of products, the data requirement and protocols for pre-market clearance, the consensus of industry-best-practice, and the licensing of food production in China"". Mr. Feng also shared that with cultivated meat being listed in the 14th Five-Year Plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, “the Chinese government has already posted a positive attitude towards this new technology, and now is the right time to start communicating with the Chinese government for further development"", says Mr. Feng.</p>
<p>Representatives from China Meat Research Center (CMRC) and China Meat Association (CMA) also participated in the panel to share their views on cultivated meat and its technological development. CMRC commented that cultivated meat production is a revolutionary technology that combines innovative techniques from different fields, but they also noted that there is a lot of work to be done to build up a respective framework; CMA expressed its support for building an industry platform, saying that a focused channel might be helpful in starting a conversation with the officials.</p>
<p>Notably, China-based cultivated meat startups recognized the urgent need for the industry to come together and work as a group to promote and grow. They reached a consensus that a cohesive platform is critical to coordinate efforts and to create synergies that benefit all. ""I believe the forum today is a great starting point for more collaborations between companies within China and with international players interested in entering China”, says Mr. Ziliang Yang, the CEO and co-founder of CellX, a cellular agriculture startup based in Shanghai. Meanwhile, Dr. Shijie Ding, the CEO of a Nanjing-based cultivated meat company, Joes Future Food, discussed about the local challenges that companies are facing in China, such as those in stem cell research and bioreactor equipment designs. Dr. Ding emphasized with a positive note that ""the Chinese government has shown great support to green technologies, especially in cultivated meat”. From the cultivated seafood sector, Avant Meats remarked on the uniqueness of each regulatory system, suggesting that “startups can contribute data to Chinese regulators to formulate a framework for food safety assessments to help speed up the legislation process”, says Carrie Chan, CEO and co-founder of Avant Meats.</p>
<p>Aside from local organizations and companies, overseas parties such as Aleph Farms, APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture, BlueNalu, Merck KGaA, and Japan Association for Cellular Agriculture, also participated in the discussion of advancing regulations and contributed to future project ideations. Under collective efforts, the Forum is orienting itself to help push the regulatory status forward in China and around the world. In the future, cellular agriculture will become one of the deciding means to greatly reduce the use of energy, freshwater, and arable land for food production. With such a large consumer base and an ever-rising protein demand, cellular agriculture has a strong stance in China, and the China market is certainly attractive to a lot of players outside of the region.</p>
<p>*China-based organizations are represented by research institutions such as East China University of Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, and Zhejiang University; local cultivated meat companies such as Avant Meats, CellX and Joes Future Food; industry partners such as AgFood Future, APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture, Japan Association for Cellular Agriculture, the China Meat Research Center, China Meat Association, GFIC, Lever VC, etc. Industry leaders from across the globe with interests in the China market also attended the Forum panel, which included upstream manufacturers such as Merck KGaA, Esco Lifescience Group, downstream companies such as Aleph Farms, BlueNalu, IntegriCulture Inc., Mission Barns, Mosa Meat, Shiok Meats, SuperMeat, TurtleTree Labs, UPSIDE Foods, etc., and research institutions such as Tufts University/National Institute for Cellular Agriculture, etc.</p>",10764

<p><strong>ABOUT FUROID™</strong></p>
<p>FUROID™ is a cultivated biomaterial developed especially for the fur industry. The product is molecularly identical to animal fur, feels and behaves the same but offers many more advantages. After all, the product is 100% animal-friendly, extremely durable and hypoallergenic. It is made through three dimensional bioprinting. This method combines cells with growth factors and biomaterials to create biomedical parts, with the aim of mimicking natural tissue properties. This is more or less comparable with the technique for cultured meat.</p>
<p>GENEUSBIOTECH sees a huge gap in the market for FUROID™. Fur is the oldest form of human clothing. In the early days of mankind, fur was a means of braving the cold. Today, fur is the epitome of conspicuous luxury. But all this comes at an enormous cost in terms of animal suffering. Every year, more than 100 million animals are killed for their fur. Since animal rights activists rightly point out this unnecessary suffering and since it became clear last year that fur animals can easily pass on COVID-19 to humans, the fashion industry has been careful in promoting fur. Not a bad thing in itself, but the downside of this is that it has led to an increase in the illegal trade in fur with even worse consequences for the animals, and to the emergence of synthetic alternatives that are very harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>Since the problem is not fur itself, but rather the production method, GENEUSBIOTECH has refined its technique to produce fur in an animal-friendly manner. The approach is simple: to make fur acceptable by eliminating animal suffering and toxic production methods to develop synthetic variants. The researchers at GENEUSBIOTECH are acting in the same way as the leather industry, which is also looking for alternatives to natural leather derived from animal skins. Incidentally, GENEUSBIOTECH has filed a patent for the technology in 2019 and last year the company obtained approval on ethical grounds to set up experiments to obtain cultivated wool.</p>
<p>GENEUSBIOTECH does not want to enter into a debate on whether or not to wear fur. Fur must be recognised as a natural attire, but the way in which it is obtained can and must be questioned. It is not acceptable that millions of animals have to suffer to dress people. But people should - if they choose 100% for sustainability (read animal friendly) - be able to enjoy wearing fur. The intention of FUROID™ fits in with the recent attempts by cellular food companies to create foods such as caviar, foie gras and wagyu beef that are completely animal friendly and can remove the dilemma between taste, pleasure, and guilt.</p>
<p>FUROID™ seeks a balance between luxury - in this case wearing fur - and sustainability - in this case excluding animal suffering. FUROID™ wants to give people the opportunity to wear fur, to be willing to pay the price they deem necessary and yet not be burdened with a sense of guilt for supporting an industry that uses animal abuse, illegal or not, as a technique to get to the product. The fact that people want to live a high-end lifestyle should not be a reason to fish these people out if they agree to do so in a way that is good for the animals in particular and our environment (read: no synthetic variants) in general.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT GENEUSBIOTECH</strong></p>
<p>In May 2020, GENEUSBIOTECH entered into an R&amp;D project with various research institutions to further develop the technology of bioprinting. This will include the cultivation of biomaterials such as cell-based fur, as well as the cultivation of human hair for transplantation into the scalp.

Globally, only a few companies are driving cutting-edge R&amp;D efforts to offer alternatives to the conventional production of meat, fish, and poultry. They use animal cells to produce tasty, sustainable products that eliminate animal suffering and promise an ecological footprint far superior to that of factory farming.</p>
<p>Bluu Seafood (formerly Bluu Biosciences) and CellX, two pioneers in the field of cellular agriculture, have now decided to work together. Bluu Seafood is the first company in Europe specializing in the production of cultivated fish and will present a first product this year. CellX is the leading cultivated meat company in China and has showcased multiple forms of products in 2021. The company is located in Shanghai, the hub for biotech and innovation in China. It started with a focus on domestic Chinese pig breed and has quickly expanded to beef and poultry. Both companies are at the forefront of advancing regulatory approval in their respective region: Chris Dammann, COO of Bluu Seafood, is a VP and board member of Cellular Agriculture Europe, and Ziliang Yang, founder and CEO of CellX, is Secretary of the APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture. Bluu Seafood and CellX are now joining forces as part of a strategic partnership. Going forward, the partners will support each other along the whole value chain when expanding into the respective markets – this ranges from the procurement of raw materials to the construction of production facilities and possible sales partnerships. They plan to jointly establish supply partnerships and also promote consumer acceptance of cultivated protein products. The two companies have a different product focus but are committed to the same goal using similar technologies to make cellular agriculture a reality.</p>
<p>""We are pleased to form this strategic partnership with Bluu Seafood as an industry leader in cultivated seafood and board member of Cellular Agriculture Europe. CellX and Bluu Seafood have a complementary focus regarding species and market geographies. This partnership will serve as a starting point for deeper collaboration between the two companies and will encourage more collaboration across the industry. We are solving a global issue, and this requires a global solution,"" said Ziliang Yang, CEO at CellX.</p>
<p>“China has the world's largest consumption of seafood and is therefore a particularly important market for Bluu Seafood. Together with CellX, we are working to overcome the challenges in sourcing, scaling, and obtaining regulatory approval concerning cultivated fish and meat to bring affordable and tasty products to market. We are delighted about this Chinese-German partnership in which we are working together on the future of food,"" emphasized Simon Fabich, founder and managing director of Bluu Seafood.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based company is researching and developing at its second location in Lübeck and will open up additional production capacities in Hamburg this year.</p>

<p>The $1 million project will see Burcon partnering with Pristine Gourmet, a processor of 100% pure Canadian non-GMO cold pressed virgin oils, to further develop Burcon’s novel process for the production of sunflower protein ingredients.  Premium sunflower protein isolate, that contains greater than 90% protein purity and have exceptional taste and functionality, has the potential of setting a new benchmark in the growing plant-based ingredients market. Leveraging Burcon’s core protein extraction and purification platform, the project intends to fine-tune and scale up an economical extraction and isolation process arising from the by-product (pressed cake) of sunflower oil production.</p>
<p>“Sunflower protein checks all the boxes as an ideal source of plant-based protein,” said Peter H. Kappel, Burcon’s interim CEO and Chairman of the board, adding, “With this investment, Burcon and Pristine Gourmet can accelerate the development of value-added premium protein ingredients coming from a by-product normally used as animal feed.”</p>
<p>Protein Industries Canada’s co-investment further supports Canadian innovation in the development of cutting-edge food technologies and patent-pending processes to develop products that are unique in the global plant-based protein marketplace.</p>
<p>“Canada’s plant-based food and ingredients sector has seen tremendous growth over the past several years, thanks largely to the innovation shown by our entrepreneurs and researchers,” Protein Industries Canada CEO Bill Greuel said. “The development of new ingredients, processing technologies and food products is key to seeing this growth continue. As our companies work together to bring these developments from idea to full-scale implementation, Canadians can look forward to a strengthened economy, new healthy and sustainable options on grocery store shelves, and an increased ability to meet the growing global demand for plant-based protein.”</p>
<p>Sunflower protein ingredients are naturally non-GMO, have a favourable taste profile, low allergenicity, are particularly label-friendly, and easily understood and accepted by consumers.  As the world’s third largest oilseed crop, behind soy and canola, sunflower seed has significant potential to be a major source of protein within the plant-based food revolution.  Sunflower seed proteins produced using Burcon’s extraction technology exhibit unique and potentially valuable functional characteristics as well as a nutritional profile similar to that of canola protein.  Unlocking the potential of protein present in sunflower seed for mainstream food ingredient applications could mean that we would be unlocking vast quantities of novel plant protein worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>About Burcon NutraScience Corporation</strong></p>
<p>Burcon is a global technology leader in the development of plant-based proteins for foods and beverages. With over two decades of experience formulating high-purity proteins that have superior functionality, taste and nutrition, Burcon has amassed an extensive patent portfolio covering its novel plant-based proteins derived from pea, canola, soy, hemp, sunflower seed, among other plant sources. In 2019, Merit Functional Foods Corporation (""Merit Foods"") was established between Burcon and three veteran food industry executives.

The landmark approval for mung bean protein paves the way for the launch of JUST Egg in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.","<p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Eat Just, Inc., a company that applies cutting-edge science and technology on a mission to create healthier, more sustainable foods, announced today that the key ingredient in its popular plant-based JUST Egg products has <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/comitology-register/screen/documents/079416/1/consult?lang=en"">received approval from the European Commission</a>. The landmark approval for mung bean protein paves the way for the launch of JUST Egg in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>This decision means America’s fastest-growing egg brand can enter the market in countries belonging to the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. The allowance also ensures that Eat Just’s pioneering use of mung bean protein for plant-based egg products cannot be leveraged by other food companies seeking to introduce similar products for five years unless those companies obtain authorization through the same novel food application process.</p>
<p>“Forward-thinking consumers in Europe have been asking for JUST Egg since the day it launched in the U.S. Whether because of climate change, health or a connection to animals, the demand has been significant as has interest from retail and foodservice partners. I'm grateful for the recent approval, which opens the door to begin distribution across Europe before the end of the year,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just.</p>
<p>The Commission’s action is based upon the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) earlier determination that <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020005499/en/JUST-Eggs-Key-Ingredient-Receives-European-Safety-Approval-Paves-Way-for-Launch"">mung bean protein</a> is safe under novel food requirements.  Mung bean protein is the first novel legume protein to be deemed safe under the regime that has governed all new food ingredients entering Europe since May 1997.</p>
<p>Eat Just successfully collaborated with analyze &amp; realize GmbH, a leading regulatory consulting agency specializing in natural health products, on the novel food dossier compilation and EFSA and Commission submissions. The company is also actively engaging with the UK’s Food Standards Agency on a regulatory path to market.</p>
<p>Recent studies show European consumers are hungry for plant-based products and the egg category is one of the biggest areas of opportunity.

The company aims to launch cell-cultured foie gras this year as its first line of cell-cultured meat products.","<p><strong>Inexpensive food-grade serum-free basal medium</strong></p>

<p>IntegriCulture Inc. performed the first successful cultivation of chicken and duck liver-derived cells in a serum-free basal medium by the CulNet system, which emulates natural inter-organ interactions.<sup>*1</sup> We have successfully replaced all research-grade materials with food materials to achieve functional equivalence at a reduced cost. We became the first to implement a cell culture by serum-free basal medium that other cell-cultured meat producers around the world are also working on. The cost of cultivation using IntegriCulture’s basal medium (product name: I-MEM) and CulNet system has been estimated to be about 1/60 of media using animal serum. We are aiming to launch cell-cultured foie gras this year as our first line of cell-cultured meat products.</p>

<p><strong>Animal serum is essential for traditional culture methods</strong></p>

<p>Conventionally, basal medium supplemented with 5-20% animal serum is used to cultivate animal cells. Serum contains growth factors, albumin, and hundreds of other proteins, and these components are essential for cell proliferation. Without serum, the cells would be undernourished and unable to survive for a long time, let alone proliferate. However, animal serum is expensive and has ethical issues, so there is a worldwide competition to develop an alternative. It is said to cost US$3,000 (about 320,000 yen) to produce a 1 pound (about 450 g) chicken nugget using traditional serum-added media.<sup>*2</sup></p>

<p><strong>Production of serum components made possible by the CulNet™</strong></p>

<p>The “CulNet system” developed by IntegriCulture uses inter-organ interactions to produce serum components and use them for cell cultivation. The system consists of a bioreactor for cultivating multiple “feeder cells” (feeder bioreactor) and a bioreactor for cultivating cells that will become the product (product bioreactor) (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Feeder cells are the cells that secrete suitable serum components for the cells in the product bioreactor. Multiple feeder bioreactors, each containing one type of organ cell, are connected together. All bioreactors are filled with basal medium containing basic nutrients such as sugars and amino acids, that circulates throughout. The main feature of the CulNet system is that the feeder bioreactor continuously supplies the serum components required for the target cell culture. Feeder cells “cultivate” each other, while producing the serum to proliferate cells in the product bioreactor. In our in-house evaluation, just changing the basal medium regularly in the CulNet system maintained mutual cell cultivation for over 130 days. The serum-like components secreted by the feeder cells include albumin, transferrin, and others according to our analysis. Another feature of the CulNet system is that the combination of organ cells in the feeder bioreactor changes the type of cells that can be proliferated in the product bioreactor. Through numerous screening experiments, IntegriCulture has discovered the optimal combination of organ cells to facilitate the efficient proliferation of chicken and duck liver-derived cells (patent pending).</p>

<p><strong>The CulNet™ facilitates faster cell proliferation than using animal serum</strong></p>

<p>We found that using CulNet’s serum-free medium produced by a certain combination of feeder cells led to faster proliferation of liver-derived cells than conventional medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) (Figures 2 and 3). The cell doubling was 1.5 — 2.5 times faster, and thus concluded that the CulNet system can replace animal serum in proliferation of liver-derived cells. We expect increased commercial production efficiency and significantly reduced costs (Figure 3).</p>

<p><strong>CulNet PIPELINE — contract research and development project</strong></p>

<p>IntegriCulture is the first to implement cell culture by serum-free basal medium that cell-cultured meat producers around the world are working on. There is a wide range of potential industrial applications in cell cultivation such as cosmetics, leather, pharmaceuticals, and others. The applicability of CulNet system extends beyond poultry, including mammals, fish, crustaceans, insects, and so on. IntegriCulture aims to build a cellular agriculture platform encompassing hardware,media, materials, products and markets. We stay committed to our corporate mission of building a universally accessible cellular agriculture infrastructure by building a cellular agriculture value chain.</p>

This action not only represents a first for Africa, but also the birth of a major new technological drive to produce more essential animal protein for people. Cultivated meat is a potential game-changer for the planet, and more specifically for Africa’s biodiversity and wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>With the expanding population in Africa, which is expected to double in the next 30 years, we are rapidly outstripping our ability to supply affordable and nutritious food. Cultivated meat has the promise to address food security and add nutritional value without further high-impact agricultural practices that are having devastating effects on Africa’s biodiversity and wildlife.</p>
<p>In recent years we have seen the food industry pivot towards alternative meat and sustainable sources of protein, with plant-based meat-like products, and now cultivated meat coming onto the scene. Globally there are already over 100 start-up companies working in the cultivated meat space with billions of dollars being invested. It is thrilling that South Africa is among those 100 companies and has achieved such a significant milestone of showcasing Africa’s first cultivated chicken.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months Mogale Meat has been working tirelessly using cutting-edge scientific research and innovation to produce cultivated meat from free-roaming livestock and wildlife such as cattle, and antelope. Although Mogale Meat’s focus is on being a cultivated game meat company, they have produced Africa’s first chicken breast prototype using cultivated meat technology in just 8 months to compete in the global $15million XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion competition. Mogale Meat Co, the Managing Partner of the MeatOurFuture project, in collaboration with Biotechnology and Food Science, Tshwane University of Technology and the School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal is the only semi-finalist team, of 31 teams, from the continent of Africa for this prestigious competition. Each team was given a choice between chicken or fish, and MeatOurFuture decided on chicken, as this is not only the most popular meat in Africa but the most widely eaten meat worldwide.</p>
<p>Mogale Meat’s vision is to make healthy and nutritious cell-based meat accessible to all in Africa. The team is currently working on prototyping a unique modular plug-and-play concept production plant that will allow cultivated meat to be made where the people are. This will not only provide the people across the continent of Africa with affordable and nutritional animal protein but do so in a way that conserves Africa’s precious wildlife and biodiversity. The biggest challenge Mogale Meat and other cultivated meat companies are currently facing is firstly bringing down the cost to manufacture the meat at scale, and secondly paving the way for regulatory approval. Although cultivated meat is real meat, it does require policies surrounding food safety, production, as well as trade to be updated to include cell-cultured meat that is produced without the conventional way of slaughtering live animals.</p>
<p>Cultivated meat is produced by taking a small biopsy from a living animal and growing the cells in a bioreactor, much the same way that the cells would grow in an animal, but much more efficiently and without the addition of unwanted growth hormones, antibiotics, and other chemical compounds. Producing meat through cell technology also means reducing the environmental impact of raising more livestock to keep up with human consumption demands. Less land has to be ploughed to feed animals in feedlots, less water is required and most importantly wildlife and the incredible biodiversity we have in Africa can be conserved by transitioning to cultured meat production.</p>
<p>Dr Paul Bartels, a wildlife veterinarian, and the Founder and CEO of Mogale Meat says “Mogale Meat Co is raising the bar by developing BestByNature food technology that will not only impact the way people view and eat healthy game meat, but also do so by supporting the economic and social wellbeing of the wildlife industry, National Parks and the communities living with wildlife.” Mogale Meat aims to conserve Africa’s wildlife heritage through the provision of sustainable animal protein for the people of Africa and the world through cultivated game meat created from the cells of free-roaming antelope and cattle.</p>
<p>The cultivated chicken breast, composed of real chicken muscle and fat cells blended with a mushroom matrix, is the first prototype Mogale Meat will showcase. A signature wildlife meat product will be revealed later in the year.</p>
<p>For Mogale Meat it is extremely exciting to be at the forefront of food science and innovation on a global scale and a huge privilege not only for South Africa but Africa as well. The Mogale Meat team strives to improve the health, socio-economic and environmental impact of consumer meat products, one meal at a time.</p>",10676

<p><strong>Beijing </strong>- China should adopt a “greater food” approach and look at plant-based, fermented and cell-cultured animal protein in addition to traditional food sources as a way to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development, announced Chinese President Xi JinPing in a recent speech. The speech, delivered March 6, 2022 at the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), President Xi also stated that science and technology are key to food security and that the government should be aware of the changing trends in people’s food choices. President Xi’s remarks were reported publicly after the event <a href=""http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-03/06/c_1128443977.htm"">by state-affiliated news agency Xinhua</a>.</p>

<p>“Apart from traditional crops, livestock, and poultry resources, we should expand the use of biological resources,” President Xi told delegates. “By developing biological science, biotechnology, and bio-industries, we can obtain calories and protein from plants, animals, and microorganisms.” The remarks follow the recent release of the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs’ new Five-Year Plan, which calls for “research and development in cultivated meat, plant-based egg, milk, and oil, recombinant protein technology” and other high-technology areas as important for food security and long-term economic development. President Xi is one of only a handful of global leaders to have publicly embraced alternative protein as an important strategic priority for development.</p>

<p>“The government’s call to diversify protein sources and develop the alternative protein space, including by using biotechnology to produce animal proteins through cell cultivation and fermentation, will provide major tailwinds to the growth of this sector,” said Lily Chen, Program Director at Lever China, which works to promote entrepreneurship and investment in the alternative protein sector in the country. “Lever China is committed to helping company founders, investors and food brands grow the alternative protein sector, and to helping China be a global technology leader in plant-based proteins and in the cultivation and fermentation of animal protein.”</p>

<p>The number of alternative protein start-ups in China has increased significantly in the past three years, with over RMB 1.563 billion (USD $245 million) invested in the sector during the period. A recent market study by Lever China and leading Chinese food media outlet <em>Food Plus</em> found that 90% of Chinese consumers would eat cultivated meat and 30% would consider making cultivated meat their main source of protein in the future if pricing and taste were able to match the conventional version.</p>

<p><strong>Vienna, Austria, March 7, 2022</strong> -- Vienna-based ingredients startup Arkeon Biotechnologies has closed its seed financing at more than 7 million US Dollars in an oversubscribed funding round. Arkeon is the first company in the world to leverage the technology of gas fermentation with the power of archaea, an ancient microorganism with unique properties, for food applications. The company’s proprietary technology produces all 20 amino acids for the human diet in one production step.</p>
<p>On a mission to create the most sustainable, nutritious, and ethical food system, Arkeon uses highly efficient microorganisms – archaea – to produce functional and customizable protein ingredients. With a technology that is fully independent from agricultural land and with the ability to directly convert CO2 into food ingredients, the company holds the key to unlocking a food system without resource constraints, without geographical restrictions, and free from animal suffering.</p>
<p>Leading food and climate investors including Synthesis Capital and ReGen Ventures participated in the investment round. The capital raised will be allocated towards scaling up production levels, process engineering, and product development.</p>
<p>The founding of Arkeon was supported by the Berlin-based company builder EVIG, which specializes in working with scientists to build biotechnology startups in the food sector.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with experienced investors who strongly believe in our vision to produce the next generation of protein ingredients just from CO2” explained Dr. Gregor Tegl, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Arkeon Biotechnologies.</p>
<p><strong>The wonders of Archaea – an underexplored microorganism holding unique potential</strong></p>
<p>Archaea are one of the most ancient microorganisms in the world and are intertwined with the creation of life on earth. They are exceptional in their capabilities and evolved to thrive in extreme environments like underwater volcanoes.</p>
<p>Whilst these microbes are still an underutilized and underexplored lifeform, Arkeon’s proprietary technology holds the key to unlocking their potential: The company’s science team comprises the world’s leading Archaea technologists led by Simon Rittmann, Arkeon’s CSO, renowned in the scientific community for pioneering the biotechnology process for archaea and his dedicated research on the microorganisms over the last decade.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling a fundamental shift away from current industrial agriculture practices </strong></p>
<p>Compared to modern agriculture, which relies on lengthy processes involving many steps such as growing, harvesting, and purifying, Arkeon offers an incredibly efficient shortcut: A single step is needed to produce the desired ingredients. In doing so, the company effectively bypasses traditional agriculture, allowing for food production without crop dependencies.</p>
<p>Since more CO2 is consumed than produced during the gas fermentation process, Arkeon’s products will be carbon-negative. “For the first time in history, we can turn the equation of modern food production upside down and turn a resource-intensive industry into a sustainable, low-emission system”, says Dr. Gregor Tegl.</p>
<p><strong>Creating nutritious, functional, and delicious food – molecule by molecule</strong></p>
<p>Arkeon’s proprietary technology converts CO2 directly into an entire range of all 20 amino acids – all of which are essential for the human diet – as well as functional peptides that will bring a variety of high-value ingredients to customers. The company can produce different compositions of aminos which further allow to generate various protein ingredients of varying nutritional and functional profiles.</p>
<p>Arkeon’s customizable products are 100% vegan-friendly, GMO-free, and can be used as clean label ingredients for plant-based foods, nutrition products, beverages, cultivated meat cell culture media, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>About </strong><strong>Arkeon GmbH (Arkeon Biotechnologies)</strong></p>

Bluu Seafood will be introducing its first product based on cultivated fish and plant components in the second half of this year. Full market launch will depend on the regulatory requirements in the respective target markets and is most likely going to take place initially in Asia, the UK, or the US, before EU-approval will be granted.</p>
<p>Research and development remain important to produce cultivated fish products on a relevant scale. However, with process optimization already achieved, Bluu Seafood is now focusing on the development of market-ready cultured fish products that no longer differ in taste, texture and cooking behaviour from comparable products based on wild-caught or aqua cultured fish.</p>
<p>Dr Sebastian Rakers, founder and managing director of Bluu Seafood explained: ""As a company, we are continuously growing and evolving. Changing the brand name to Bluu Seafood reflects this evolution. We are growing organically, mastering the processes, and are now focusing increasingly on product development and go-to-market.""</p>
<p>Heavy fishing and marine pollution are threatening fish stocks worldwide. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that more than 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are either overfished (33.1%) or fished to maximum sustainable levels (59.9%). Therefore, sustainable alternatives are needed to ensure a long-term supply of animal protein for the world's population. Bluu Seafood is working to create one of those alternatives with cultured fish that is delicious, healthy, and sustainable.</p>
<p>""We believe that cultivated fish will be an important alternative source of protein to feed the world's growing population in the future, and Bluu Seafood is well positioned to tackle the upcoming scaling process,"" emphasized Dr Christian Dammann, Chief Operating Officer of the company. ""Fish and fish products are traded and consumed internationally, so from our perspective it makes sense to start with a brand name that is widely understood and immediately tells consumers what it is all about.""</p>
<p><strong>About Bluu GmbH (Bluu Seafood)</strong></p>
<p>Bluu Seafood (previously Bluu Biosciences) is the first company in Europe to specialize in the development and commercial production of cultivated fish. As a pioneer at the interface of biotechnology and food technology, Bluu Biosciences is stepping up to produce high-quality, sustainable fish products from cell cultures, that feature high nutritional value and a premium flavour profile.

It finds that a 10% price reduction, which could be within the next year, would have a minimal effect on US cattle production. The authors project that while it would reduce ground beef production by about 1.2%, it would only reduce the number of cattle slaughtered by 0.15%. The shift in demand would also only modestly reduce cattle and beef prices.</p>
<p>The decline in production and prices would put downward pressure on the revenue and profits of cattle producers, packers, and input suppliers to the cattle industry. Yet like the decline in prices and production, it would be limited—an order of magnitude less than the average year-to-year variation.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this modest impact:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plant-based beef and meat consumption is currently low, accounting for <a href=""http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6MFolrgiprpISFwWYpBS-2Fe8awMYHAa69ZtdYRvnwlXA-2FImri_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dRa9pvC3dv-2F3cnkI3wMbk7OdhElAzpQwzcQZCuxSVwq3yCSfvndNJZ0EG0smZjBiYOo-2B9eerpYXXCQNnrs57-2Bey3-2FtZv6QccnSzL4ZMVwaJQ53bh9N1jli7azfWyfqurMTfzJ4ga180cVg0NGhLiUOvrSoforrPUhkm72RR7HHFmw-3D-3D"">1.4%</a> of US meat sales. Even a large percentage increase in consumption would still result in a relatively low market share, moderating the effect on animal-based meat consumption and production.</li>
<li>Consumers only partially substitute plant-based meat for conventional meat, meaning that an increase in plant-based meat consumption doesn’t proportionately reduce animal-based meat consumption.</li>
<li>Plant-based beef is primarily a substitute for ground beef. When ground beef demand declines, cattle producers can sell more meat as sirloins, chucks, ribs, and other non-ground products.</li>
<li>More than 10% of beef produced in the US is exported. When domestic beef demand declines, cattle producers can increase exports. </li>
<li>Cattle are typically raised for about 18 months, so producers can’t quickly shift production to respond to market changes. In the long run, we expect plant-based beef price declines to have a modestly (~12%) larger effect on the number of cattle slaughtered, but a smaller one on producer profits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to these economic dynamics, the authors project reductions in plant-based beef prices would also have only modest environmental benefits.</p>
<p>As detailed in another recent report, “<a href=""http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6FbZujzKnehUr0brmLcf5S0lj5XdUb8OWGfLA6vxqGMNFagKqhdwc03flXp8oKo2E-2FBbKjUadcpLJEWIDS0UnDpQZ4wgdZwNURxhk9jzTDXDGCRy_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dSjTNvA9XAdviBIaCAqT3pz9rbnAaO9yGEKlCWQ6cYTZdC5O1dYaJyIxy3lRuIUVMaKS08WyDNY2l-2By-2FV9-2FDcqBhhNBGcfTGy0wjAX4qCworfUl65xTTr8qUNXArH0LzBwC5khpeX0Pa79s25PaCQPa5hTB1jIEkVAkqN6wc6yjAw-3D-3D"">The Case for Public Investment in Alternative Proteins</a>,” to capture more consumer demand in the future and to have greater environmental benefits, the taste and texture of alternative meats must continue to improve and new types of products, such as substitutes for whole cuts of meat, must be developed. This will likely require fundamental, government-funded research as well as public support for scaling up new alternative meat technologies and more dramatically reducing costs.</p>
<p>But improving the environmental sustainability of meat cannot solely rely on alternative meat.

However, academic curricula still do not cover topics that would prepare students for work in this field. The Cultivate Tomorrow initiative aims to help bridge that gap, organizing students from all disciplines to tackle key challenges in the industry through a cellular agriculture-focused hackathon, the first of its kind in the US. Cultivate Tomorrow was initiated and directed by Jasmin Kern, a cultivated food enthusiast and senior studying Chemistry at MIT. In July 2021, she gathered a group of passionate and forward-thinking students across US academic institutions to build this event.</p>
<p>The inaugural Cultivate Tomorrow hackathon is organized into three tracks: scientific communication, advertising strategy, and innovative resource use. Each team of 3-5 students is paired with an industry mentor. The Cultivate Tomorrow team recruited 170 student applicants from around the country last fall, and currently have nearly 130 students participating.</p>
<p>“From conceptualizing the first nation-wide cultivated food hackathon to directing the first iteration of Cultivate Tomorrow, I have gotten to know so many impressive and inspiring people working to revolutionize the food industry. I am thrilled to see how much new talent has been waiting for a chance to step into this industry, and that we can offer them this opportunity,” says Jasmin. </p>
<p>To conclude the Cultivate Tomorrow Hackathon, the organization will host a virtual pitch day on February 12, 2022. This event will be open to everyone interested in the cultivated food industry, biotechnology applications, and sustainable food and agriculture sectors. The event will feature the hackathon team presentations and awards ceremony. The event is hosting a panel moderated by Danielle Nierenberg, the president of Food Tank, on the ethics of the commercialization of cultivated food products featuring New Harvest Executive Director Isha Datar. To inspire the new generation of students, a panel on navigating entrepreneurship and start-ups is scheduled featuring founders, and intrapreneurs in the industry who will provide insight into running a company in the cell ag industry.</p>
<p>Benny Larson, PhD and VP of Research and Product Development at Wildtype believes that “students need to know that there is a big future here in the new food economy. Bio and chemical engineering students, bioprocess specialists, and others are likely all plotting the career path right now to work in pharma, but we need these folks to take a look at other paths and be able to see cell ag as being able to provide a viable, sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Kicking off the year with this far-reaching event will make 2022 the biggest year for cultivated food and cell ag yet! This event will foster collaboration and partnerships between many important players in the industry from suppliers to food manufacturers, from biotechnology innovation and research to investing and marketing experts.</p>

<p><strong>Shanghai –</strong> A new study of over 2,000 consumers across China finds 90% say they would eat cultivated meat, and 30% would make it their main source of protein if it can achieve the same taste and texture as conventional meat. The study also found that, among a variety of different Chinese language names tested, the Chinese term for “customized meat” (订制肉) generated the greatest consumer interest in the category. The study, which analyzed Chinese consumers' perceptions of the new sector, willingness to try, long-term purchase intentions, and demographic differences,<strong> </strong>was conducted by Lever China, a Shanghai-based consultancy specializing in the alternative protein sector, and Food Plus, a Shanghai-based media and research institution focusing on entrepreneurships in the food industry.</p>
<p>The survey showed that the Chinese term for customized meat received the highest evaluations in multiple dimensions, including taste, product attractiveness, convenience, nutrition, and for being the most natural. 订制肉 (“customized meat”) also had the best performance in boosting interest in trying the product and in eating it regularly. A Chinese term for “clean meat” also performed well, standing out in dimensions of health, food safety and sustainability. By contrast, Chinese terms for “cell meat” and “cell-cultivated meat” performed relatively weakly in encouraging consumption. Previous studies have found that the English term “cultivated meat” likely works best for English-speaking audiences.</p>
<p>As one of the sectors of the alternative protein field, cultivated meat has garnered significant attention in China in recent years. With the Chinese government’s increasing emphasis on issues such as food safety and environment sustainability, cultivated meat is becoming an important innovation area to optimize the nation’s protein resources and help the country to achieve its carbon reduction goal. Baoguo Sun, a member of the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, noted during the Thirteenth National People's Congress in 2020 that “cultivated meat has become the most popular research topic in the global meat industry, and is expected to become the most effective method to solve meat supply problems in the future.”</p>
<p>The FoodPlus and Lever China study also found that if the taste and texture of cultivated meat is the same as conventional animal meat, more than 60% of respondents would purchase it occasionally, with another 30% making cultivated meat the main type of meat they purchase. In total, more than 90% of consumers would add cultivated meat to their diet alongside traditional animal meat. Respondents aged 26-40 showed the highest level of interest.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited to see the huge interest in ‘customized meat’ by the Chinese public,” said Cecilia Zhao, alternative protein project manager of Lever China. “Choosing an authentic Chinese name that can balance the technology, marketing appealing, and culture familiarity is an important step to help with the industry’s development in China. The study suggests that using the term 订制肉 (“customized meat”) can help the government and industry meet its goals in this sector by increasing public interest and willingness to try the product, which we believe is critical for building a national sustainable system of meat consumption in the future.”</p>
<p>“The cultivated meat sector has been receiving increasing attention due to the concern of global population growth and climate change,” said Ziliang Yang, Co-Founder and CEO of leading Chinese cultivated meat company CellX. “It's particularly important to better communicate with consumers and reach consensus in the industry. Thanks Lever China and FoodPlus for conducting the survey to help consumers understand more about the emerging industry.""</p>
<p>“The name gives consumers the first impression of the product. Whether the naming can accurately convey what cultivated meat is and gain consumer acceptance is very critical,” said Doris Lee, general manager of GFI Consultancy. “We hope that Lever China's report could stimulate a wide-ranging discussion on the naming of cultivated meat and help the industry to find a name that is suitable for the China market.”</p>

The investment round was taken by Lever VC, a leading global investor in the alternative protein category whose partners are investors in Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, THIS, and many other category leaders.  </p>
<p>Tiba Tempeh was founded in 2019 by Alex and Ross Longton, food industry veterans with 30 years of experience in senior sales and marketing positions at Kraft Heinz and other food industry leaders. After discovering the benefits of eating a plant-based diet the team wanted to use their food industry experience to help people eat more naturally healthy plant-based foods as they found a lack of such products in the market. On a trip to Indonesia they discovered tempeh, a deliciously natural plant-based protein made from soybeans using a special fermentation process, and Tiba Tempeh was born.</p>
<p>Tiba Tempeh specialises in innovative tempeh products with the current range including Sweet Chilli, Curry Spiced and Soy Marinade pieces that are sold diced, marinated and ready to cook, making them a deliciously convenient meat-free solution for stir-fries, curries, salads, wraps and more.  The company also launched the first ever tempeh burger in UK supermarkets. Unlike many other meat-free products Tiba Tempeh is made with 100% natural ingredients and boasts over 22 grams of protein per 100g serving, a similar level to meat.  The range is also organic, high in fibre, vegan and made with live cultures, tapping into the growing trend towards gut health.</p>
<p>“Tempeh is a growing category opportunity for consumers who want more natural meat alternatives, and Tiba is hands down the best tasting tempeh product we’ve ever come across,” said Nick Cooney, Managing Partner of Lever VC. “We think Tiba Tempeh’s very experienced team, strong brand, exciting innovation and growth plans will position them to be a leading global brand in the category.” </p>
<p>Meat-free has been the UK’s fastest growing food category, growing 42% year on year, with tempeh sales growing ahead of the category at 112% year on year.  Since launching just over a year ago, Tiba Tempeh has grown quickly and is already listed nationwide in the UK in stores such as Ocado, Planet Organic, Whole Foods and Selfridges. The company has also grown its direct to consumer sales, foodservice channel and supplies to recipe box companies including Mindful Chef.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited about our partnership with Lever VC, which will accelerate our growth both in the UK and internationally,” said Alex Longton, Managing Director of Tiba Tempeh. “Lever VC’s expertise in the sector will add significant value to further scale the business and help us on our mission to create a healthier world by inspiring people to eat more naturally healthy and sustainable plant-based foods.”</p>",10252

Novo Holdings, a leading international life sciences investor, today announced a significant investment in 21st.BIO A/S – a new Danish bioindustrial scale-up company.</p>
<p>Established in 2020, 21st.BIO has been founded with a mission to support bioindustrial companies globally in upscaling from molecule innovation to large-scale production to be able to meet market demands and thereby advance the green transition globally. The focus areas of 21st.BIO include producing proteins and peptides that can be utilised for the food, materials and agricultural industries. It is estimated that as much as 60% of the physical inputs to the global economy could be produced biologically.</p>
<p>Today, much of the transformational bioindustrial innovation is never commercialised because of the challenges that occur when production has to be scaled from the lab processes to full-scale manufacturing. The production environment in which the molecule was originally developed is often unable to deliver the right quality and at acceptable cost levels.</p>
<p>A common issue facing innovators in industrial biotech is also a lack of access to competencies and facilities to develop a molecule production process that can deliver the desired quality at the cost levels required to compete effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Schmidt, co-founder, and CEO of 21st.BIO, said: </strong>“Many brilliant industrial biotech ideas never succeed, because production challenges result in too high price points for the final product. Hence, a vast number of otherwise great innovations do not make it to a scale at which they are truly relevant for the world. At 21st.BIO, we can help establish the right technology for producing novel molecules and peptides and hence help innovators successfully make the difficult step from innovation to big business and impact for the planet. We have gained access to a selection of Novozymes’ unique technology platform on commercial terms, which means that a success for 21st.BIO is also a success for Novozymes.”</p>
<p>The technology platform of 21st.BIO originates from selected parts of Novo-zymes platform, which has been developed and perfected over the past 40+ years.</p>
<p>Novozymes provides a co-exclusive licence to 21st.BIO within certain boundaries of applications, ensuring Novozymes’ ability to continue its leadership position in the areas where Novozymes operates. </p>
<p><strong>Claus Crone Fuglsang, Executive Vice President of Novozymes, commented:</strong> “A strong industrial biotech environment, supported by enabling start-ups to bring innovation to scale, will help build future markets. The entire industry will benefit from a thriving development of new biological solutions. This is an opportunity to leverage our technology in a different context and enable a transition to-wards a biobased society and create further value – also for Novozymes’ share-holders.”</p>
<p><strong>New manufacturing site on the horizon</strong></p>
<p>Novo Holdings is investing EUR 86 million in 21st.BIO. Søren Møller, Managing Partner of Novo Seeds, Novo Holdings, will join the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased to join 21st.BIO on its mission to help more biological solutions reach the market and thereby enable the acceleration of the green transition. The technology that 21st..BIO offers addresses a critical, unmet global need, and I see great potential for synergies and partnerships between 21st.BIO and other Novo Holdings portfolio companies in the industrial biotech sector,” <strong>said Søren Møller.</strong></p>
<p>21st.BIO currently operates in Denmark and California. The access to selected parts of Novozymes R&amp;D platform and the investment by Novo Holdings will enable the company to expand its capacity further.</p>
<p>“With the access to a selected part of Novozymes technology platform and financing from Novo Holdings, 21st.BIO will be able to grow and to establish the first manufacturing site to serve our customers globally. Further, with both Novo Holdings and Novozymes on board, we are getting access to a broader network and knowledge base that is very advantageous,” <strong>Thomas Schmidt said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The technology explained </strong></p>
<p>21st.BIO helps customers optimising and developing the appropriate expression platform for large-scale production of their particular molecule by testing the molecule using various expression platforms, such as fungi, yeast or bacteria. When the right expression platform has been identified, 21st.BIO draws on its comprehensive strain bank and selects and optimises the best-performing strains. This leads to an optimised production platform that enables clients to produce their product at commercially attractive costs and quantities.</p>
<p>To Novozymes, the opportunity base will materialise as 21st.BIO succeeds with its projects, and revenue will be generated from licensing income as technologies are commercialised.</p>

<p>Davis, CA, December 20, 2021 — NuCicer, a crop genetics company pioneering new varieties of chickpea, unveiled today ultra-high protein varieties with 75% more protein than conventional chickpeas. The new varieties will cut the cost of chickpea protein nearly in half, making it cost-competitive with other plant proteins such as soy, wheat and pea.</p>
<p>“Chickpeas are the ideal plant protein, with a neutral flavor and color, excellent functionality, and positive consumer sentiment,” said Kathryn Cook, NuCicer co-Founder and CEO. “Now for the first time, NuCicer’s new varieties – the product of ten years of research amassing and crossbreeding the world’s largest and most systematic collection of wild crop progenitors with cultivated chickpea – will enable chickpea protein to outcompete other leading plant proteins like soy, wheat and pea.”</p>
<p>Chickpea is already the third most widely grown grain legume and a significant source of human nutrition worldwide. The United Nations recognizes chickpea and other pulses as a key global crop for our food system and promotes their nutritional and environmental importance through a yearly “World Pulses Day”. NuCicer shares this vision and is reinventing the chickpea as a resilient crop for the future with increased protein content and targeted functional and nutritional properties. The range of new varieties developed by NuCicer will enable more sustainable, affordable plant proteins as well as high-protein, gluten-free flours and whole bean products. Additionally, NuCicer is working to increase yield and production stability by incorporating traits for environmental resilience such as heat and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>NuCicer’s background chickpea germplasm stems from international research projects spanning the last decade led by Professor Douglas R. Cook from the University of California Davis. International researchers trekked through southeastern Turkey with permission from local authorities to collect thousands of samples of wild crop progenitors. By crossbreeding this wild material with cultivated chickpea varieties, scientists expanded available genetic diversity by 40 times and discovered important traits that do not exist in either the cultivated or wild material alone. NuCicer uses this extraordinary genetic potential to bring high-value traits such as increased protein content to market and contributes back to global biodiversity and food security efforts through an international treaty with the Food and Agriculture Organization of  the United Nations. The company is now scaling operations with a plan for commercial protein and flour ingredient production in 2023.</p>
<p>“We are excited by our initial progress and the breadth of opportunity as we begin to partner with leading food and beverage brands,” added Kathryn Cook. “We are in conversations with partners who recognize the opportunity of new ingredients from our high-protein chickpeas and are moving quickly to enable meaningful impact across the agri-food supply chain.”</p>
<p><strong>About NuCicer</strong></p>
<p>NuCicer, Inc. develops novel, high-protein chickpea varieties that enable scalable, sustainable ingredients spanning whole beans, gluten-free flours, and protein ingredients. It partners with growers who are attracted to chickpea’s capacity for nitrogen fixation and interested in NuCicer’s potential to increase the crop’s environmental resilience. NuCicer also partners with ingredient manufacturers and food and beverage companies who recognize the potential of chickpea as a sustainable, functional ingredient.

<p>Those reinvented biomolecules are used to fuel the next generation of biotechnology innovations in various fields such as cellular agriculture and cultivated meat, regenerative medicine, and novel vaccine production. These new fields rely on reagents accounting for more than 80% of the production cost. But Tiamat offers key proteins 10X cheaper than the current market offers with fermentation technologies.</p>

<p>“Our technology can help to promote animal-free alternatives not only for food but also for the pharmaceutical industry,” said France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO of Tiamat Sciences. “Plants are a great system to work with; they grow fast, are small water and energy consumers, and they are compostable. The technology offers flexibility with production for a diversified product portfolio.”</p>

<p>The Tiamat team designed its proprietary production process by combining biotechnology, vertical farming, and computation design to reinvent recombinant proteins. While having already achieved a 10X cost decrease for its current products with lab-scale practices, the company is planning to achieve a cost decrease of 1,000X by 2025 with large-scale production for a wide catalog of products.</p>

<p>With its two operating sites, in Belgium and the U.S., team Tiamat is forging global partnerships and preparing its expansion to include additional local production facilities. The company is already on its way to reach carbon-neutral production. Those strategies will allow Tiamat to reduce its environmental footprint and offer string supplies in a field that has endured numerous raw material shortages over the past several years.</p>

<p>“From regenerative medicine to cellular agriculture, numerous companies are looking for animal-free solutions for their activities,” said Adil.<strong> </strong>“Our exclusive plant-based production system allows us to answer those needs with a wide range of reagents. By targeting nascent markets on the verge of scale-up, we’ve already demonstrated significant traction for our solutions and an early revenue potential that is outstanding for a biotech startup.”</p>

<p>“Affordable animal-free growth factors are a long-awaited ingredient for cellular-agriculture companies in their mission to bring cultured meats to the market,” said Ryan Bethencourt, CEO of Wild Earth and Tiamat Science’s chairman. “Thanks to its innovative production platform using plants as bioreactors, I’m confident that the Tiamat team will address both the price and scalability challenges on one of the most exciting markets of the century.”</p>

<p>“We follow best-in-class founders into the future as they invent the missing pieces of their industries,” said Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures. “This is absolutely the case with the Tiamat team. Their innovations in cellular agriculture and biotechnology will advance multiple industries and even the work of other companies in our portfolio. We’re here to play a supporting role in this exciting shift to a more plant-based future.”</p>

<p>To continue its work, Tiamat Sciences will build its pilot production facility in prominent technology research center Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.</p>

CDKs provide streamlined access to the company's platform for aspiring cell developers to program cells to tackle the biggest challenges facing society. The first CDKs to launch are focused on protein expression programs. The service provides developers access to the toolkit needed to get started developing commercial proteins, including pre-engineered host cells optimized for protein production, specialized equipment, automation capabilities, genetic engineering expertise, insights garnered from Ginkgo's codebase and the applicable infrastructure to design, build and test a custom microbe.</p>
<p>Ginkgo's CDKs are designed to cut the cost of launching a cell program and speed up development timelines to build engineered microbes, for example, to determine whether a protein may be successfully and commercially produced. The service is also designed to enable customers to prototype their idea in phases, with each phase providing data that can inform the customer's project and business strategy. By simplifying the pathway for companies to get started on the Ginkgo platform with standard terms, a phased approach, low costs—starting at $100,000 for protein expression projects—and clear deliverables, the CDK can help derisk projects prior to full scale technical development.</p>
<p>""We believe engineering biology holds tremendous potential to revolutionize industries and our customers are using it to develop solutions ranging from alternative food proteins and vaccine ingredients to biodegradable plastics and sustainable chemicals,"" said Jason Kelly, CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks. ""But biology is still complex and highly variable, making the barrier to entry too high for many of the product developers that are out there with an idea they want to bring to the world. By providing these researchers, entrepreneurs and dreamers with the resources to realize their proof of concept, we're able to support the synthetic biology ecosystem to keep pushing the envelope on innovation.""</p>

<p><strong>November 4, 2021</strong> – Materials industry nonprofit think-tank <a href=""https://www.materialinnovation.org/"">The Material Innovation Initiative</a> (MII) and <a href=""https://www.themillsfabrica.com/"">The Mills Fabrica</a>, an investor and ecosystem builder in sustainable agrifood, textiles, and fashion industry innovations, have published an analysis of the materials industry detailing “white space” opportunities for animal-free, sustainable leather, down, wool, silk, fur, and exotic skins.
</p>
<p>“Our goal is to show this nascent industry underserved technological efforts that will make a big impact,” says MII Chief Science Officer Sydney Gladman, Ph.D. “These white spaces do not focus on a single product or market, but instead highlight opportunities that will produce a ripple effect across the entire next-gen materials industry and beyond.”</p>
<p>The Mills Fabrica notes that – like the alternative protein industry a decade ago – the next-gen materials industry is replete with untapped opportunities. Innovators and investors are now in a position to start the next-gen material versions of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, reaping the rewards of future billion-dollar companies.
</p>
<p>“We are delighted to join hands with The Material Innovation Initiative to discuss the untapped potential of the next-gen materials. As consumers’ awareness of sustainability continues to increase, it’s the right time to keep the traction by introducing these material innovations to the wider community,” says Angus Tsang, Research and Investment from The Mills Fabrica.</p>
<p>MII’s co-founders, Nicole Rawling and Stephanie Downs, both came from the world of alternative protein.</p>
<p>“Stephanie and I have seen this sort of industry-wide change happen before, and today’s materials industry looks very familiar to us,” notes MII CEO Nicole Rawling.</p>
<p>For this analysis, MII and The Mills Fabrica define white spaces as areas with significant opportunity for focused R&amp;D and the creation of new technologies and companies to fulfill unmet needs across the next-gen ecosystem.
</p>
<p>The most significant white spaces are in materials other than leather. Approximately two-thirds of current players are producing next-gen leather. This leaves silk, wool, down, fur, and exotic skins with limited innovation efforts so far, providing many profitable opportunities, especially in fur and silk.</p>
<p>Other white spaces identified include:
</p>
<p>●      Sustainable feedstock and additives (White Spaces 2,3,4).</p>
<p>●      Versatile end-of-life strategies (White Space 5).</p>
<p>●      Implementing bottom-up materials design in R&amp;D (White Space 6).</p>
<p>●      Hot spots in biotech process challenges (White Space 7).</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, industrial animal farming is a leading cause of many of the most pressing problems of our time. These include climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, air and water pollution, excessive waste, public health risks, and animal cruelty. Given that at least two thirds of a brand’s sustainability impact can be tied to its choice of raw materials, brands will need alternatives to current animal materials to meet sustainability goals.</p>
<p>There are opportunities available across the board. Dr. Amanda Parkes, chief innovation officer at next-gen clothing company Pangaia, puts it simply: “We need a lot of people doing some things better, rather than a few people doing everything perfectly.”</p>
<p>This whitespace report provides a roadmap for innovators and investors – as well as brands, startups, scientists, and engineers – looking to do well by doing good.</p>

Thanks to this incubation program, launched by Pascual Innoventures in collaboration with Eatable Adventures, these promising startups are set to lay the foundations for a new path of development and innovation for the dairy industry and respond to the big challenges it faces.</p>
<p>Mylkcubator is not only the world’s first incubator specialized in the dairy sector, but also establishes itself as an international reference with its four chosen startups coming from different continents. These startups were carefully selected for their projects and technological developments to obtain the dairy products of the future.</p>
<p>According to Sejal Ravji, director of Pascual Innoventures, <em>""Mylkcubator launches its first edition with the aim of marking a dramatic before and after in food innovation. I think we are facing global challenges that can only be resolved thanks to bold bets like this; it’s a starting point for the development of the dairy products of the future.  It’s a very ambitious project at many levels, including technological, but we’re partnering with leading experts, companies, and investors from all over the world who share our vision to make it happen"".</em></p>
<p>Thus, Pascual, through Pascual Innoventures continues to promote innovation, anticipate trends and create a more sustainable food system future for all. The Mylkcubator program is another testament to their commitment to this end.</p>
<p><strong>The selected startups:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real</strong> <strong>Deal Milk</strong> (Spain) develops milk proteins through precision fermentation in order to make dairy products that are produced without animals but are nutritionally and gastronomically equivalent to traditional dairy products.</li>
<li><strong>Zero Cow</strong> <strong>Factory</strong> (India) producing India's first milk &amp; dairy products (certainly a world's first in A2 milk protein) using microbial bioengineering &amp; precision fermentation.</li>
<li><strong>De Novo Dairy </strong>(South Africa) uses precision fermentation technology to produce animal-free dairy proteins that provide the same sensory experience and nutrition as their traditional dairy counterparts.</li>
<li><strong>M2Factors</strong> (USA) 108Labs' subsidiary M2Factors, Inc is accelerating the state of the art in cell-cultured dairy by crashing the cost of production.</li>
</ul>
<p>The launch of Mylkcubator has attracted the attention of companies, technology centers and professional investors from all over the world.</p>
<p>Renowned research hubs have already expressed their willingness to collaborate with some of the selected startups in the development of their research. In fact, these partnerships will allow the teams to work in some of the most cutting-edge facilities of these research centers, ‘professionalizing’ and boosting the development process of the projects.</p>
<p>In addition, leading funds investing in startups working on technologies for developing protein alternatives in the agri-food sector, such as Blue Horizon, Lever VC, Unovis or Ninepointfive, a venture capital fund specialised in leveraging corporate acceleration, will also monitor Mylkcubator's technological developments to advise these startups and look for future collaboration opportunities to maximize the potential of their projects.</p>
<p>The incubation program will commence with the first sessions to determine the state of development of each project both at a business and technological level with guidance from Pascual Innoventures, Eatable Adventures and the investors and partners involved. In addition, the feasibility of the innovations and the possible development of pilot projects for future business opportunities in the dairy sector will be studied.</p>

<li><em>In 2022, over half (56 per cent) of food and drink manufacturers will invest in developing new plant-based products, followed by clean labels (37 per cent) and low calorie (34 percent) </em></li>
<li><em>Broadening product ranges to appeal to flexitarians (48 per cent) and vegans (47 per cent) was the most common reason for plant-based investment</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OCTOBER 2021:</strong> New research commissioned by Atura Proteins<a href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>, UK-based manufacturer of naturally produced pulse protein ingredients, reveals food and drink brand owners and manufacturers are most likely (56 per cent) to invest their new product development budgets in the development of plant-based products in 2022.</p>
<p>Broadening product ranges to appeal to flexitarians i.e., those who eat a plant-based diet without eliminating meat completely (48 per cent), and vegans (47 per cent) was the most common reason for plant-based investment, with interest from retail customers and environmental concerns both on par (36 percent).</p>
<p>Of the 102 UK-based food and drink professionals surveyed, four in ten (41 per cent) believe that meat alternatives, plant-based substitutes for meat such as mince, will be the biggest growth category for plant-based foods, followed by cereals (13 per cent) and cheese (12 per cent).</p>
<p>A third of industry professionals (34 per cent) claim that difficulty of sourcing ingredients is the biggest barrier to developing plant-based products. More than a quarter (29 per cent) claimed the biggest barrier was consumer resistance related to taste and formulation issues.</p>
<p>Paul Donegan, Commercial Development and Marketing Manager at Atura Proteins believes that the development of plant-based products needn’t be complicated. </p>
<p>He said: “Our research suggests that plant-based is a big priority for professionals in the food and drink industry, tapping into evolving vegetarian, flexitarian and vegan consumer diets. The increase in demand presents a significant opportunity for food and beverage brands.  Our survey suggests that decision makers may have challenges sourcing some plant-based ingredients which may reflect the supply chain pressures brought about by increasing demand.</p>
<p>“The plant-based food market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% from 2020 to 2027<a href=""#_ftn2"">[2]</a>, and there are now an estimated 8.7 million flexitarians in the UK<a href=""#_ftn3"">[3]</a>, so it’s a great time for businesses to think about tapping into the market.” </p>
<p>Atura Proteins manufactures pulse proteins at a facility in Somerset, UK, offering a regional source of supply for European customers with potentially reduced food miles. Pulses such as chickpeas, fava beans and red lentils provide high levels of protein.  Crucially for the food industry, Atura Proteins offer unique functionality in terms of texture and structure building; a key part of product formulators toolkit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with protein fortification high on the agenda, incorporating plant protein to deliver a <em>source of protein</em> claim is important for product formulators. More than half (55 per cent) of decision makers confirmed that developing protein fortified products typically came in response to demand from more health-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Paul continued: “Protein is enduring in its popularity and the trend towards protein fortification shows no sign of slowing. Coupled with the trend towards plant-based, food and drink manufacturers, there is a real opportunity to consider alternative protein sources, like fava beans, chickpea and red lentils, to help deliver optimal food and beverage products for consumers.”</p>
<p>The other key areas of new product development for 2022 include clean labelling, using as few ingredients as possible and ensuring they are natural, which 37 per cent of industry professionals believe will be a key area for investment and low-calorie options that a third of respondents (34 per cent) see as a growth area.</p>

<p>“Leaders from across the value chain are urgently calling for action towards the protein transition to plant-based foods if we are to make a difference for planetary health: it is about transformation, cross value-chain impact, and getting more decision-makers at the table,” says CEO Gerard Klein Essink.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://bridge2food.com/moonshot-2030-plant-based-proteins-key-to-sustainable-future/"">panel</a> about what is needed to make the transition to more plant-based foods and who is going to get us there, five senior leaders agreed innovative, integrated efforts will be required.</p>
<p>“We need to have people from around the world in the room,” said Sara Eckhouse, executive director of FoodShot during the discussion.</p>
<p>The need for greater collaboration is key for driving change all along the value chain and that theme was emphasized at virtually every session.</p>
<p>“Ecosystems are thriving and people are working collectively across geographical or other boundaries. The food industry is behind other sectors in learning to work collaboratively and strategically but that is changing — fast,” says Klein Essink.</p>
<p>Ecosystems are exciting right now as working together is what will help solve larger scale problems such as climate change, said Scott May, head of innovation platform MISTA in a <a href=""https://bridge2food.com/how-do-you-build-an-ecosystem-3-creators-talk-you-through-it/"">panel discussion</a> about how to build ecosystems.</p>

<p>The key to providing eco-certified products is first good, reliable data that is useful to the food system and those projects are underway.</p>
<p>“We need the whole spectrum involved,” said Savell. “The idea is for us to come together and do it collectively.”</p>
<p>Over three days Sept. 27-29 about 400 delegates, 14 speakers, 27 panelists and 18 startups gathered virtually to look at ways to further advance the plant-based industry.</p>

<p>“Our ads aim at the truth. People can’t care about the health of the planet or their family all of the time. We want to disarm people and their presuppositions about plant-based foods with insightful humor and irreverent swagger,” said Tom Rossmeissl, Head of Global Marketing at Eat Just. “We want to capture real, often hectic modern breakfast moments through a diverse lens that broadens perceptions and makes everyone feel that no matter where they are on their dietary journey, if they like really good eggs, they’re with us.”</p>
<p>Buzzworthy “Really Good Eggs” billboards will appear throughout the fall in cities across America and in-store and curbside advertising will reach shoppers at thousands of brick-and-mortar retail locations. Additional activities include paid influencer campaigns on popular social media platforms, search engine marketing, sponsored e-commerce search, e-mail marketing and more. The campaign was developed in partnership with New York City-based creative studio Mythology.</p>
<p>“Really Good Eggs” is confident, unapologetic and signals the progress that the plant-based food industry has made in recent years by making delicious, affordable products that appeal to a broad and growing community of consumers. Eat Just aptly unveiled the campaign at the <a href=""https://gfi.org/event/good-food-conference-2021/"">2021 Good Food Conference</a>, the world’s most in-depth, cross-sector gathering focused on the power and potential of alternative proteins to fundamentally change food and agriculture.</p>
<p>Today's news comes as JUST Egg celebrates several key milestones. JUST Egg products are now available in approximately 24,000 retail points of distribution and more than 1,000 foodservice locations and the company is nearing the plant-based equivalent of 200 million eggs sold. JUST Egg is No. 1 in household spend and consumer loyalty among branded eggs and is in 1.3 million U.S. households, up 45 percent since January.<a href=""https://outlook.office.com/mail/sentitems/id/AQMkADI0OTIwZmJhLTg3YWYtNDgyZi1hYjk0LTNkYTg5ODdjM2VkZgBGAAAD4N%2BDpGTxy02kIcAFOmffBgcAD%2F6D9GbGt0%2BVN76PBzBzqwAAAgEJAAAAD%2F6D9GbGt0%2BVN76PBzBzqwABxG6NmgAAAA%3D%3D#x__ftn1"">[1]</a> Recent launches in South Africa and South Korea build on the brand’s growing international presence, which also includes Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and China. </p>

<p>Balletic Foods uses a proprietary fermentation technology to produce its first product, Balletic Protein™. The output of the scalable process are pure proteins that are designed and engineered for high performance, ready to become the core building blocks for a variety of food and supplement applications.</p>
<p>“Highly optimized proteins will be the future of sports nutrition” explains Anita Broellochs, Founder and CEO of Balletic Foods. “We’re seeing a huge wave in alternative protein technology, but a lot of the products are not designed for health and muscle recovery.”</p>
<p>Cellular agriculture technology is making headwinds as the demand for protein worldwide rapidly increases. Protein plays an important role for individuals who are physically active as it can reduce muscle soreness and promote muscle repair. Balletic Foods has identified key opportunities to develop an efficient protein that is optimized for high performance activities and supports muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>In comparison to plant-based proteins, animal-based proteins traditionally have a high protein score, a measure of the protein quality found in foods, suggesting they are more usable by our body for general growth, maintenance, and repair. This is due to their high digestibility and complete essential amino acid profile. However, traditional methods of sourcing animal-based proteins are not sustainable. Balletic Foods is a mission driven organization committed to eliminating the exploitation of animals in the agricultural system.</p>",9715

GOOD Meat will use the funds to increase capacity and accelerate research and development for high-quality, real meat made directly from animal cells. ABG, LLC; BofA Securities, Inc.; Guggenheim Securities and VERSO Capital advised on the transaction.</p>
<p>Also today, GOOD Meat added two highly regarded food and agriculture leaders to its ranks. Dan Glickman, who is well-recognized in the fields of agriculture, nutrition, hunger, bipartisan politics and public policy, will serve on its Advisory Board; and Jim Borel, former Executive Vice President of DuPont, will join its Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Glickman served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from March 1995 until January 2001; spent nearly two decades as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives; and is actively involved with organizations that fight domestic and global hunger and promote agricultural research in pursuit of a safer, more sustainable food system. Borel, who during his four-decade career at DuPont led its DuPont Pioneer, Crop Protection and Nutrition &amp; Health businesses, is also on Eat Just’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>“I'm proud to see our company take the next step toward building large-scale cultivated meat production. This investment, along with the guidance of Secretary Glickman and Jim Borel, puts us in a position to execute our plans in multiple regions around the world,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just. </p>
<p>“I’m delighted to join GOOD Meat’s Advisory Board where I can assist the company in its efforts to provide protein options that can ultimately help feed a growing and hungry population worldwide, safely and sustainably. While I will always support family farmers’ work to feed the world in the U.S. and elsewhere, this company’s innovative technologies can augment opportunities over the longer term for consumers to expand their choices and improve their diets,” said Glickman.</p>
<p>The investment and additions of Glickman and Borel follow GOOD Meat’s <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210831005602/en"">announcement earlier this month</a> that it plans to build the first-ever cultivated meat facility in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region through a partnership with Doha Venture Capital and Qatar Free Zones Authority.

The fundraising came half a year after the Shanghai-based cultivated meat startup’s initial pre-seed round in late 2020. Other investors participating include Sky9 capital, K2VC, Lever VC, Better Bite Ventures, and others.</p>
<p>CellX aspires to bring cultivated meat products to consumers in China and around the world. With over half of global pork supply consumed in China, and as Chinese government commit to cut carbon agressively in the next few decades, cultivated meat is considered a solution for China’s pork crisis and food security issue. It can significantly contribute to low carbon transition of the country in the long term as well as the nascent industry get to scale.</p>
<p>The company’s 25 scientists and impact entrepreneurs works out of its headquarter in Shanghai Zhangjiang, a leading biotech hub in China. The company has developed multiple prototypes, including structured products with scaffolding and 3D bioprinting technologies.</p>
<p>CellX is led by four cofounders with diverse backgrounds across the field of business and scientific research. CEO Ziliang is a former consultant from Boston Consulting Group with experience advising top executives from Fortune 500 companies. Scientific lead Dr. Ning Xiang was a postdoc fellow in David Kaplan's lab at Tufts University, researching tissue engineering for cultivated meat. She received her PhD from Purdue University and has more than ten years of experience in food science. Dr. Binlu Huang is also a scientific lead who received her Ph.D. from Tsinghua University and was a postdoc fellow at the University of Basel and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before joining CellX, Dr. Huang worked in the CAR-T industry in China. Cofounder Ran Liu received his MBA from Stanford University and is a serial entrepreneur in deep tech.</p>
<p>As the only team from China, CellX was selected as a semifinalist in XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion Competition. The $15 million competition, launched in December 2020, is aimed at reinventing how humanity will feed future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivated Meat in China</strong></p>
<p>In May 2020, during China’s annual Two Sessions, cultivated meat was discussed as a major solution to make China’s food supply more sustainable and crisis-resilient. Cellular agriculture is well positioned to help China solve its food security issues and achieve carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>China is the world's largest meat market. Worldwide meat consumption is projected to grow by 88% from 2010 to 2050 (<a href=""https://www.wri.org/insights/how-sustainably-feed-10-billion-people-2050-21-charts"">WRI</a>). As wealth accumulates, the demand for animal protein in China increased from 2000 to 2019 by 32% per capita. More than 50% of global pork is consumed by the Chinese, and with insufficient and volatile domestic supply,  6.4 billion dollars worth of imported pork was sold in 2019 in China  (<a href=""https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market"">USDA</a>). The demand for animal protein in China is bound to increase with the addition of around 120 million middle class households in the next decade (<a href=""https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market"">USDA</a>), but domestic resources in animal feed, arable land and freshwater supply cannot suffice such demand. Cultivated meat provides a promising solution to reduce the need for animal protein from factory farming, and a stable supply of high quality protein from local sources can relieve China's reliance on meat importation.</p>
<p>Although China has been the world's largest meat market, cellular agriculture in the country  is still an emerging field. Given food security concerns, complexity in the regulatory approval process,  better access to local consumer tastes and dietary patterns, Chinese cultivated meat companies are considered to have advantages over its global peers in the local market. As of today, CellX is one of the only three cultivated meat companies in China. As a pioneer in the field, CellX is rapidly expanding and hiring top-notch scientists and form partnership with institutions globally.  </p>

A Children’s Book About Cellular Agriculture” aims to educate children in the age 3 to 7 about cell-cultured meat technology and inspire young readers to develop a love for STEM.","<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong>: Future Food Enthusiast Alex Shirazi, host of the Cultured Meat and Future Food Podcast, together with Anita Broellochs, Founder and CEO of Balletic Foods, and Gabriel Gonzalez, California based artist, are launching a children’s book about cellular agriculture technology. The children’s book, entitled “Where do Hot Dogs Come From? A Children’s Book About Cellular Agriculture” aims to educate children in the age 3 to 7 about cell-cultured meat technology and inspire young readers to develop a love for STEM.</p>
<p>The story was inspired by a childhood experience of one of the team members, Anita, who grew up on a farm in Southern Germany. As a child, she became friends with the cows that were living in her backyard until one day she realized where all the sausages and meats were coming from. The book is taking the typical question of children where different foods, in this case hot dogs, come from into a different direction than what you would expect as an answer if the hot dogs were produced in a conventional way. Instead of a story that no one would like to hear, it takes a different direction and turns a family BBQ into a scientific journey where the “mom” explains how hot dogs are made with cellular agriculture technologies. A happy ending for everyone involved, including the neighborhood cow.</p>
<p>Cellular Agriculture is a technology that could change the global food system. Cultured meat, also known as cultivated meat or cell-based meat, is meat product such as beef, chicken, or even fish created using a combination of biotechnology, tissue engineering, molecular biology, and synthetic biology and without the need for animal slaughter.</p>
<p>The team is using Kickstarter as their fundraising platform due to it’s reach towards the STEM demographic. Supporters of the project can contribute and back the project with packages starting at the $5 tier. Supporters can also be part of the project through larger packages that include getting illustrated in the book.</p>

</ul>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, June 23, 2021 - Provenance Bio, a San Francisco-based alternative proteins company, announced today that it has made animal-free gelatin using their proprietary protein expression platform.</p>
<p>The gelatin made by Provenance is designed to be identical to traditionally-sourced animal gelatin, while using no animal inputs.</p>
<p>Traditionally, gelatin is made from collagens extracted from cow or pig hides and bones. Gelatin is used in a wide array of consumer goods such as in capsules for vitamins and therapeutics, as an ingredient in foods for imparting texture, and as a key component used in tissue engineering.</p>
<p>Provenance Bio is focused on producing animal-free gelatin to address issues in the market such as inconsistencies in quality and to make products devoid of contaminants. Provenance Bio also makes its gelatin from collagen, which is produced in their microbial platform. For its recombinant gelatin products, Provenance currently uses full-length, type I collagen, the most abundant form of collagen in mammals but produced in a clean laboratory setting. Provenance gelatins promise to have the same functional attributes as those derived from animal collagens but with a radically reduced environmental footprint.</p>
<p>“Gelatin represents a large and growing market. We were inspired to make an animal-free gelatin to provide a sustainable and humane solution for this material, while solving major concerns with animal derived gelatins that suffer from animal-borne illness, batch-to-batch variability, and price fluctuations. Provenance collagens, which are entirely animal-free, also support the growing demand for vegan alternatives to gelatin products with superior performance,” says Provenance Bio CEO, Michalyn Andrews.</p>
<p>In addition to full length bovine collagens, Provenance is utilizing a library of collagen variants for tailored applications.</p>
<p>“We are excited about all the possible industrial applications of Provenance gelatins, as well as other proteins. The platform will produce animal-free gelatin at attractive price points. When we began our work at Provenance, there was no way to make the proteins we needed at scale,” she says. “We took it upon ourselves to redesign a new chassis for protein production that would revolutionize our ability to deliver functional proteins at price parity with those sourced from animals. While we still have a road ahead of us, to date, we’ve been able to increase our own collagen strain efficiencies by 100x.“</p>
<p>Recombinant collagen, as a sustainable solution for animal products has been out of reach to date due to the historic challenge of producing these functional proteins. Access to biomimetic collagens with zero animal inputs, at price parity with current animal products, will enable its wider adoption across all relevant sectors.</p>
<p>Andrews continues, “Gelatin is just the first of many animal products we’re disrupting at Provenance. Full-length proteins are important for the markets we’re working to disrupt. We want our gelatin to be a seamless plug-and-play product for corporations ready to make their supply chains more sustainable. Today our collagen products have 1/50th the carbon footprint of bovine collagen products. By year end, we expect to cut that number by 90 percent, making our products over 500 times more carbon efficient than collagens and related products sourced from cattle.”</p>
<p>By partnering with large corporations for product rollout, Provenance intends to move quickly as an impact-focused organization, furthering the mission of transitioning large global supply chains for sustainable solutions.</p>
<p><strong>About Provenance Bio</strong></p>
<p>Provenance Bio is an alternative proteins company developing cutting edge synthetic biology tools to compete head-to-head with animal proteins, leveraging its patent-pending platform to make full-length collagen for B-to-B applications in pharma, biomaterials and food. The Provenance protein expression platform represents the future of biomanufacturing, efficiently making the protein building blocks needed to usher in a new era of sustainable products.</p>
<p>Provenance Bio was formed in 2020, co-founded by Michalyn Andrews, Dr. Zev Gartner, Dr. John Dueber, and Christian Ewton.</p>

cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and materials</em></p>

<p>TOKYO, JAPAN – A cellular agriculture pioneer IntegriCulture Inc. has been organizing the “CulNet Consortium”, an open innovation platform for cellular agriculture. With 12 businesses now on board, the consortium officially launched on April 1, 2021. The project builds platforms that assist cellular agriculture to enter the mainstream in food, materials and other sectors.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the Consortium</strong><br />
The global population is set to reach 10 billion by 2050, and conventional methods of supplying protein are expected to be unable to meet the demand. Although alternative protein sources like plants and other sources have already gained wide recognition, the idea of producing meat itself by cell culture technology is highly anticipated. There have been multiple attempts of cellular agriculture in different countries, but most remained only on small scales. There are still numerous problems that need solutions such as cost, safety, and production scale. The consortium was established to collaboratively solve these problems through open innovation. IntegriCulture Inc. collaborates with major companies from different sectors including scaffold, bioreactor and medium, to build a whole cellular agriculture supply chain.</p>

<p><strong>Participants </strong>(as of June 17 in no particular order)</p>

<p><strong>About the CulNet Consortium</strong></p>

<p>The vision of the CulNet Consortium is an open cellular agriculture infrastructure that is accessible by everyone. Through open innovation, we aim to develop hardware, consumables, and production and distribution methods for the CulNet System™ by collaborating with companies in Japan and overseas in the five fields listed below. Food applications of cellular agriculture require regulatory compliance in their raw ingredients. Other challenges include large-scale supply of culture medium and scaling of the cell culture process. We will conduct multiple joint R&amp;D projects with each member. The IP generated from the individual R&amp;D project will be shared among the participating members. The members can include such IP in their own businesses. The common precompetitive results obtained in the consortium will be shared among members. We plan to progressively harmonize technical standards to help create a food system capable of delivering safe, reliable products and simultaneously encouraging more businesses to join.</p>

<p>&lt;Fields where the consortium actively pursues open innovation&gt;<br />
The consortium is steadily pushing ahead with development and standardization in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standardized culture media: Recipes that are fundamentally different from the existing media (basal media). Basal media are the raw material for all cultured cell products, and a different type is required for each kind (food, material, medical, etc.).</li>
	<li>CulNet System™ hardware: Hardware that lets people use the CulNet System™ across a broad spectrum of uses, whether it’s in mass production or just at home.</li>
	<li>Product bioreactors: Bioreactors that are used to make things like the products’ edible parts. We estimate that a variety of animals used as agricultural products will be a source for the cells.</li>
	<li>Cell product processing: The process control that is needed to meet the products’ processing and safety requirements (cell components and culture supernatant).</li>
	<li>Cell sources: The process that is used to extract and culture cells from livestock and fishery resources and the systems that enable the whole sequence of processes to be completed right where the cell sources are produced—tailoring them to their intended use, source animal species, etc.</li>
</ul>

	<li><em>Japanese biotechnology startup announces </em>Cellament®️<em>, a cell-cultured ingredient for skin repair developed using revolutionary cellular agriculture technology</em></li>
	<li><em>This new product unleashes the previously untapped nutritional power of eggs by selectively cultivating egg cells instead of harvesting whole, chicken-laid eggs</em></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>TOKYO, JAPAN</strong> — IntegriCulture Inc., the Japanese biotechnology startup pioneering revolutionary advancements in cellular agriculture, <strong>today announced the launch of Cellament</strong><strong>®️</strong><strong>, the first in a new generation of bioactive skincare ingredients based on cutting-edge cell-culture technology</strong>.</p>

<p>Cellament harnesses the unique nutritional power of eggs but surpasses them in both growth factors and proteins. The result is a cell-cultured serum rich in antioxidants that aid in skin recovery, offering a radical new solution for skin repair while marking a significant step forward for the cellular agriculture industry.</p>

<p>“Cell-culture technology doesn’t just change how we source traditionally animal-derived ingredients, it also enables us to unlock nutritional and functional power that was previously inaccessible,” explains<strong> IntegriCulture Founder and CEO, Yuki Hanyu. “</strong>There’s never been a product like Cellament before, and certainly not one ready for scalable commercialization. This is a significant milestone for cellular agriculture and for the skincare industry.”</p>

<p>IntegriCulture spent years researching cell-cultured serum applications in cosmetics. As the body’s largest organ, skin requires proper nutrients for optimal health, and few sources offer as complete a nutritional profile as eggs. By selectively cultivating three types of egg cells — the amnion, yolk sac, and plasma membrane — IntegriCulture can amplify the potency of key nutritional elements far beyond levels found in chicken-laid eggs, and with significantly greater resource efficiency than conventional chicken farming. These three substances are then combined to create the serum comprising the base of Cellament, which can be used in a wide variety of cosmetics formulations.</p>

<p>Cellament has been shown to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Inhibit between 10-70% of enzymatic activity that degrades skin elasticity</li>
	<li>Accelerate the production of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a protein that facilitates faster skin cell turnover, increasing skin smoothness while also preventing wrinkle formation</li>
	<li>Increase the production of enzymes and proteins associated with keratinocyte moisture retention — 90% of the skin’s outermost layer is made up of such keratinocytes — while also decreasing the production of enzymes that lead to skin dryness</li>
	<li>Target free-radical processes that accelerate disease and aging by reducing OH radicals and lipid peroxidation, thereby reducing the unwanted blemishes, pigmentation, and wrinkles associated with aging</li>
	<li>Inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines responsible for skin redness by mitigating UV damage</li>
	<li>Reduce sebaceous pore size and sebum secretion, which mitigated acne and blackheads in an 8-week trial</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Cellament breakthrough was</strong> <strong>made possible by IntegriCulture’s unique CulNet System™ technology</strong>. Standard cell-culture systems have faced serious scalability bottlenecks due to the high costs of special nutrients called growth factors, which typically need to be purchased and fed to target cells in inefficient batch processes. In contrast, IntegriCulture’s CulNet System replicates the physiology and biochemistry of the body’s internal organs to produce its own growth factors. “CulNet continuously produces, recycles, and optimizes growth factors to meet the needs of the cells they feed. This solves one of the industry’s greatest challenges toward achieving scalability and cost reduction for cell-cultured products,” said IntegriCulture CTO Dr. Ikko Kawashima.</p>

<p>The company received an additional € 4M from Blue Horizon Ventures, Novo Seeds, Nordic Food Tech, and angel investor Giampaolo Cagnin. The total seed round, which also included Vækstfonden, was € 6M.</p>
<p>Chromologics was founded in 2017 as a spin-out from the Technical University of Denmark. Since closing their initial seed round in July 2020, they have expanded the team, improved their production yields, engaged with customers, and initiated the regulatory approval of their flagship product, a natural red food color. This new investment not only strengthens the company’s initial strategic vision, but also allows Chromologics to explore and expand the portfolio to address other market segments.</p>
<p>The market for food coloring has continuously moved from synthetic to natural solutions over the last decade. Two main challenges for the natural colorants include compliance with vegan certification standards and, crucially, temperature stability to accommodate food manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>Chromologics’ platform sets a new benchmark for food colorant production. It supports the transition from the input-intensive and wasteful use of food resources towards sustainable, laboratory-grown food colorants. Instead of exploiting high-value crops and insects to extract natural colorants, Chromologics’ natural colorants are produced using precision fermentation. Chromologics is thus freeing up arable land for other crucial foods and decreasing the use of pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
<p>Chromologics is actively forming partnerships and collaborations with food manufacturers, especially those working on new plant-based meat products, to test and evaluate the Chromologics’ natural red colorant solution.</p>
<p><strong>Gerit Tolborg / CEO Chromologics</strong><br />
<em>“I am proud to be CEO and co-founder of Chromologics, and proud to be among the few female CEO’s of tech start-ups. Our journey of successfully translating academic science into a commercial product is just beginning. Our ambition is to grow Chromologics into the market leader of fermented natural color solutions, and at the same time be an inspiration for other female scientists to follow suit.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Thomas Grotkjær / Novo Seeds</strong><br />
<em>“The extended seed round, with participation of new European investors with strong domain expertise, is a clear sign of the momentum of Chromologics. I believe that Chromologics has the potential to drive a significant change in how we think about natural colors.“</em></p>
<p><strong>Regina Hecker / Blue Horizon Ventures</strong><br />
<em>“What the Chromologics team is doing is absolutely fascinating. Their technology has the potential to radically transform the global color industry as it opens the door for nature-based, safe, and reliable colors to the food and beverage industry that can be produced with far fewer resources. We are delighted to support them on this journey.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauri Reuter / Nordic Food Tech VC</strong><br />
<em>“Chromologics has set a great example both in leveraging biology to solve a hard technical problem for better food and in turning excellent research into a fast-growing company. An absolute delight for an investor.”</em></p>

<p>The organizers have scoured the globe to find trailblazers in alternative proteins, across fermentation, cell-based and plant-based solutions, and will spotlight emerging technology pioneers from South Africa, USA, Canada, China, Chile, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. </p>
<p><em>“We’re delighted to showcase the most exciting emerging talent and fresh solutions within the alternative protein space and can’t wait to welcome our international start-ups to the summit,” says</em> Jet Luckhurst, Start-Up Partnerships Manager at Future Food-Tech.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the exciting crop of globe-spanning alternative protein talent:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fermentation - Seafood</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Aqua Cultured Foods</strong> (USA) has created the first whole-cut seafood alternative using fermentation. What makes this so exciting is that our proprietary strain of fungi is grown and not processed. Allowing it to have superior nutrition to other plant-based alternatives while maintaining the familiar texture of traditional seafood,” explains Anne Palermo, Founder and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Fermentation - Dairy </strong></p>
<p>""Sustainably produced cheese that also has the flavor, texture and appeal of traditional cheese has been unachievable until now. <strong>Better Dairy</strong> (UK) is leveraging precision fermentation to bring high quality animal-free cheese to life whilst building out a rolodex of computational tools enabling them to pave a clearer path towards price-parity with traditional options,” says Jevan Nagarajah, CEO.</p>
<p>""So far, plant-based cheese hasn't captured any meaningful market share, because existing products haven't met consumer expectations in terms of price, taste, and nutrition. <strong>Stockeld Dreamery</strong> (Sweden) is creating the world's most ambitious cheese, which is why we're building the world's largest R&amp;D team for plant-based cheese, and a brand that people care about,"" shares Sorosh Tavakoli, CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p><strong>Fermentation – Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>FUMI Ingredients</strong> (the Netherlands)<em> </em>develops animal-free food ingredients from natural micro-organisms. We believe that microorganisms are an untapped source of high-value functional ingredients, which can be used to make new textures in healthy and sustainable food products,” explains Corjan van den Berg, CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p>“<strong>Noblegen </strong>(Canada) makes nutritious food with the lowest ecological footprint for a world that desperately needs to revamp the way it grows, manufacturers and thinks about food. We do this with our breakthrough, proprietary technology that enables us to efficiently cultivate an overlooked food source called Euglena,” details Hugh Williams, VP of Commercial and Corporate Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Fermentation - Meat</strong></p>
<p>“Plant-based meat alternatives are great solutions to replace animal meat consumption, but the hydrocolloid-based additives that are used in these products are not great. At <strong>Fybraworks</strong> (USA) we are working hard to replace these additives with fermentation-based meat proteins. This will result in a cleaner labelled product with nutrition and taste that closely matches the animal meat. Fybraworks: real meat taste, real world solutions,” shares Chenfeng Lu, Founder and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Based – Collagen/Gelatin</strong></p>
<p>""Currently, there are companies on similar missions to produce animal-free collagen, but their process involves fermentation technology which only produces collagen peptides (part of the protein). What makes <strong>JellaTech</strong>’s (the Netherlands) technology revolutionary is that we are able to produce native collagen using animal cells in a sustainable way, which allows our collagen to have its full functionality<strong>,"" </strong>details Stephanie Michelsen, Co-Founder and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Based - Meat</strong></p>
<p>“We’re <strong>Mzansi Meat Co.</strong> (South Africa) and we make meat in Africa, the first company to bring cellular agriculture to the continent. Our team of scientists will be working together with local nguni and indigenous cattle farmers to grow their output and make meat that is healthy and accessible. We aim to be part of the solution in securing food in South Africa and the continent,” outlines Brett Thompson, Co-Founder and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Based - Pet Food</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Because, Animals</strong> (USA)<strong> </strong>is creating the most sustainable, humane, and nutritious pet food on the planet. By growing small-prey species of cultured meat – without the inclusion of antibiotics or growth-promoting steroids! Because, Animals is creating safer pet foods made with meat that pets in the wild would naturally eat,” shares Shannon Falconer, CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Based - Substrates</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Van Heron Labs </strong>(USA) is disrupting alternative protein through one central focus: optimizing cellular health. Using an innovative bioinformatics pipeline and multi-omics data, the VHL platform analyzes and streamlines metabolism to produce superior growth and performance for any cell type, reducing costs and dependence on animal products,” explains Rebecca Vaught, Founder and President.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Based - Baby Formula</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Harmony </strong>(USA) is a food science-based company applying cutting-edge biotechnology to mimic the composition of human breast milk and create the next generation of infant formulas. Nowadays we have over 22 millions of formula allergic babies/year worldwide. Harmony produces breast milk protein-based formulas which are animal-free, allergy-free and environmentally friendly,” notes Del Afonso, CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based - Meat</strong></p>
<p>“Until now, there were only two options: dry extrusion to create minced products such as steaks or sausages, and wet extrusion to create small chicken-like pieces. However, no technology allowed to create thick fibrous whole cuts of meat. This is now possible with <strong>Umiami</strong>’s (France) unique texturization platform that allows creating thick fibrous whole-cuts in which we master both the direction and the thickness of fibers. And it is cleaner-label, too!” states Martin Habfast, Head of Partnerships.</p>
<p>""Global and Chinese consumers are more and more interested in eating healthier, and <strong>Zrou, by YouKuai Group</strong> (China) has created one of the most (if not the most) clean-labeled plant-based meat product currently in the market, and we will stick to the clean label principle in future product development,"" notes Franklin Yao, CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p>“<strong>Next Meats</strong> (Japan) is thrilled to present the world's first plant-based Yakiniku barbecue meat, the NEXT Yakiniku! Japan has a rich history of plant-based cuisine, but we’re underrepresented in the global alt-meat space. Using our authentic Japanese flavors and unique production know-how to simulate realistic, meat-like textures, we hope to bring our culinary expertise to the forefront of this emerging market,” explains Saaya Matsukubo, CMO.</p>
<p>“At <strong>Planted</strong> (Switzerland) we turn very few and natural ingredients into delicious meats from plants. Operating our own production and research facilities, we’re passionate and ambitious to create the tastiest innovations at speed and scale,” details Lukas Böni, Co-Founder.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based – Dairy and Meat</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>NotCo </strong>(Chile) is the only global company that has generated a paradigm shift in the mass consumption food industry, simultaneously breaking into plant-based products in categories such as dairy, eggs and meat. Our application solves a current problem in an innovative way, bringing plant-based products closer to animal-based products in terms of the whole consumer experience,"" shares Sofia Yasky, Food Science &amp; Technology Team Leader.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based - Seafood</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kuleana </strong>(USA) is currently patenting biotechnology approaches for creating unprocessed formats of meat. It is based on enzymatic processes that replicate the appearance and nutritional profile of raw unprocessed fish. Our technology is cost-effective and GRAS so we’ve a faster route to market compared to most processes using recombinant proteins or cell-based technology,” details Jacek Prus, Founder and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based - Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>""The demand for alternative proteins has never been higher, but the market relies primarily on soybeans and yellow peas. Brands have had to rely on what is commercially scaled instead of what is best in terms of taste, texture, or sustainability. The next era of alternative proteins needs new performance options for brands. Processing innovations have opened up those options,"" says Michael Todd, CEO at <strong>Nutriati</strong> (USA).</p>
<p>“<strong>P&amp;M</strong> (Chile) food matrixes combine ingredients that create mixes with full and balance nutritional profile and good taste since our technology lets us mask vegetal origin ingredients’ flavors that may not be appealing or present textures that are not attractive to some consumers. We use vegetal ingredients that pose a demonstrated positive effect on human health without sacrificing the great experience of eating,” explains Manuel Palma Astudillo, CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based - Drinks</strong></p>
<p>“At<strong> GROUNDED </strong>(UK), we’ve made a totally natural protein shake, entirely from plants + with absolutely no rubbish in it. Our packaging is also made from plants. In a category riddled with synthetic ingredients, our shakes stand out as the cleanest available protein shakes on the market,” shares Gabriel Bean, Founder.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based - Prebiotic Yoghurts</strong></p>
<p>""<strong>Dahlicious</strong> (USA) leverages a centuries-old tradition of “slow-culturing,” meaning our yogurts are cooked at a lower temperature for a longer period, creating the most luxurious creamy texture and a high level of probiotics.  This technique is leveraged across both our dairy and plant-based lines, including almond, coconut, and oat,” shares Pamela Goldberg, CEO.</p>
<p>Over 150 game-changing early and mid-stage companies will join the 900-strong virtual audience at the Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins summit on June 22-23. The summit will bring together food brands, retailers, ingredient manufacturers, technology providers and investors for two days of high impact online networking and knowledge-exchange to map out and accelerate the future of protein.</p>

<p>Meelunie, a leading global supplier of plant-based ingredients, believes fava will play a pivotal role in the protein transition. Helping meet the growing demand for plant-based proteins in ways that also address deforestation, inefficiencies in global agriculture and other climate-related challenges.</p>
<p>The facility will be equipped with cutting-edge processing technology from SiccaDania, and employ a breakthrough process methodology developed by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) following 17 years’ research.</p>
<p>“The UCPH breakthrough is two-fold,” explains Gijs van Elst, the project’s leader at Meelunie. “First, they’ve managed to remove the fava bean’s bitter taste, making it perfect for use in human food applications ranging from dairy and meat alternatives to sports nutrition and gluten-free products. And UCPH’s process is also more efficient, so we’re able to valorise the entire bean.”</p>
<p>Meelunie CEO Marco Heering sees this processing facility as a significant step forward. “The limited availability and suitability of local alternatives to soya has been a handbrake on the protein transition for some years. Because the fava bean thrives in non-tropical climates, such as Europe and North America, this facility can be a genuine gamechanger.”</p>
<p><a>The facility will be located near land ideally suited to cultivating fava beans and</a> produce high-quality fava ingredients. Appropriately enough, the factory design is also climate-friendly. “Water used in the production process will be filtered and reused to create a circular system,” says Van Elst, “and we’ll capture heat generated in production for reuse in the local municipality’s heating system.”</p>
<p><strong>About Meelunie </strong><a href=""http://www.meelunie.com"">www.meelunie.com</a></p>
<p>Meelunie is a leading global supplier of starches and plant-based proteins. Its product range covers a wide variety of food, animal nutrition and industrial applications, and includes trusted brands such as Windmill Potato Starch alongside an ever-growing assortment of organic products.</p>

This was the third Big Idea Ventures tasting event showcasing alternative protein innovations, but the first time offering both in-person and virtual tasting experiences. The event showcased the World’s next generation of alternative protein companies.</p>
<p><em>“Changes in global consumer demand, sustainability and food security is driving significant growth in alternative protein food innovation. Startups are fast developing alternatives to meat, dairy and seafood. We are now able to deliver a high culinary experience while delivering on these global and personal health benefits,"" </em>said <strong>Andrew D. Ive, Founder and Managing General Partner of </strong>Big Idea Ventures. Big Idea ventures is a venture capital fund with startup accelerators in key locations, investing in and accelerating top performers in the new food space. Its first fund, the New Protein Fund, has raised over USD$50 million to invest in the best companies in the alternative protein ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>“With the New Protein Fund, we will support some of the best companies globally developing meat, seafood and dairy alternatives to support the ecosystem driving big changes in the food industry,” </em>added Christian Cadeo, Managing Partner of Big Idea Ventures in Asia.</p>
<p>Chefs at Grand Hyatt created the culinary tasting experience for attendees of the event. Chef Lucas of Grand Hyatt said: <em>“Working with these plant-based products, it is a great opportunity to share with like-minded guests who care deeply for our food - where the ingredients come from and how it is being produced.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It was like a black box competition, you receive the products, it all comes in boxes, you open and see - wow these are the products, then we think what we can create with that”,</em> said Chef Gottfried.</p>
<p><em>Top trends to come out of the Tasting Event:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><u>Fermentation drives more options for alternative protein </u></li>
</ol>
<p>Fermentation can develop everything from seafood and sustainable oils, and innovations will rise in these areas in 2021.</p>
<p>The development of new alternative solutions that are entering the market will go some way to replacing their traditional products. Examples of such companies developing products are <a href=""https://www.aquaculturedfoods.com/"">Aquacultured Foods</a>, the first whole muscle seafood alternative created through microbial fermentation and <a href=""https://farmsow.com/"">Farmsow</a>, with its patent-pending microbial fermentation process delivers sustainable alternatives to tropical oils and animal fats for diverse applications..</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><u>Alternative protein dine-in and take-out options growing</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Plant-based options have thrived despite the pandemic, and many products have launched throughout the world. <a href=""https://angiestempeh.com/"">Angie's Tempeh, founded</a> during the pandemic, is now available at Vios by <a href=""https://blukouzina.com/"">Blu Kouzina</a> and <a href=""https://littlefarms.com/"">Little Farms</a> Groceries.</p>
<p>To celebrate the diversity of plant-based foods and to deliver to multicultural tastes, <a href=""https://www.plantranchfoods.com/"">Plant Ranch Foods</a>, from the US produces the only full line of plant-based Mexican flavored proteins based on generations-old family recipes and <a href=""https://www.haofood.co/"">Haofood's</a> from China developed the first peanut protein based chicken, available at various restaurants in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with many applications from Asian to Western food. Also, in light of the pandemic, <em>Tasting Big Ideas 2021</em> and 2020 offered a virtual tasting option where guests could opt to have a tasting kit delivered to enjoy in the comfort of their homes or offices.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><u>Improving Taste and Texture for Alternative Protein</u></li>
</ol>
<p>As more consumers adopt a plant-based diet, we need plant-based foods to have not only the right taste, smell and price but also the right texture and mouthfeel. Increasingly we will see technologies and companies such as <a href=""https://www.meattheend.tech/"">Meat. The End </a>which will allow plant-based foods to be indistinguishable from the traditional meats they can and will replace.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><u>Cell-based products futuristic concept overseas but a growing trend in Singapore</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Singapore was the first country in the world to give approval to the commercialisation of cell-based meat. In late 2020 the Singapore Food Agency gave approval to <a href=""https://www.ju.st/stories/plant-based-eggs?gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReamrQAXZqoZXUdOvGayU1gc-6kNKU-S0D4G7b5sK3foeRQLF97gdkhoCIDcQAvD_BwE"">Eat Just</a> to sell cultured chicken to customers.</p>
<p>Companies from Big Idea Ventures’ portfolio company, <a href=""https://www.animalalternativetechnologies.com/"">Animal Alternative Technologies</a> and <a href=""https://www.innocent-meat.com/"">Innocent Meat</a> foresee this trend and provide end-to-end solutions to scale production of cell-based meat in a cost efficient manner.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><u>Big Idea Ventures is a major supporter of female-founded companies and women founders of colour</u></li>
</ol>
<p>According to <a href=""https://veganwomensummit.com/pathfinder"">Vegan Women Summit</a>, less than 3% of all investment dollars go to female-founded companies, and yet companies with a female founder <a href=""https://vegconomist.com/society/investments-in-female-led-companies-perform-63-better-than-in-all-male-founding-teams/"">performed 63% better</a> than investments in all-male founding teams. Over 50% of startups in Big Idea Ventures’ accelerator portfolio are founded by women, and for our latest cohort, 100% of our Singapore cohort companies have a female founder or co-founder.</p>

The program is run by the group’s new Corporate Venture unit, Pascual Innoventures, on a mission to support innovative startups disrupting the dairy value chain.</p>
<p>Pascual Innoventures aims to become an early stage investor, accelerating and forging alliances with startups that share the same purpose while also thriving as a corporation by launching its own startups, with the objective of incorporating them into Pascual's future business operations.</p>
<p>The first edition of Mylkcubator will last 6 months, from selection to the demo day. The goal is to enroll 10 startups, entrepreneurs or scientific projects, with innovative solutions in the cellular agriculture spectrum for the dairy industry within the following technologies: cell based, fermentation based and applied technologies. All the details about the program are available on the official website <a href=""http://mylkcubator.com"">mylkcubator.com. </a></p>
<p>Pascual Innoventures counts on the support of Eatable Adventures, one of the top three global food-tech accelerators, deriving from their continued strategic partnership after the first plant-based dairy challenge launched in 2020.</p>
<p>According to the RethinkX report “Rethink Food and Agriculture 2020-2030”, by 2030 almost 90% of U.S. dairy protein demand will come from precision fermentation alternatives.</p>
<p>Solid protein (casein and whey) account for just 3,3% of milk’s overall composition, the 87,75% is made up of water and the rest is sugar (mainly lactose), fats, vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>The key to understanding the disruption of the dairy is that cellular agriculture only needs to disrupt 3,3% of the milk bottle, attributed to the key functional proteins.</p>
<p>Gabriel Torres Pascual, director of Pascual Innova and third generation of the Pascual family is leading the new unit together with Sejal Ravji, director of Pascual Innoventures, a biochemical engineer from UCL (University College London) with a PhD in Rheology.</p>
<p>Sej began his career in Switzerland and France, worked in various companies in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain, and also gained experience as a strategic innovation consultant as well as co-founding a FoodTech startup.</p>
<p>Gabriel Torres Pascual has worked for Google in New York and London, holds an MBA from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and completed a Master of Science at Imperial College London.</p>
<p><em>""The entrepreneurial, innovative spirit is in our genes, it comes from the attitude that my grandfather instilled in us of being nonconformist, dreaming big and daring to take risks, not only with our heads but also with our hearts. This is how Pascual Innoventures was born with a long-term vision and the purpose of giving the best for the future of food. We will work hand in hand with startups that allow us to move into the future"" </em>says Gabriel Torres.</p>
<p>In addition to this initiative, Pascual Innoventures is already working on many other strategic projects, which seek to respond and provide solutions to some of the major challenges in the agri-food sector, such as food security, health &amp; wellness, and circular economy.</p>

Yeyo is China’s first plant-based coconut yogurt with zero added sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners. Its Tmall store is the first-ever plant-based coconut yogurt flagship store on China’s leading e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>Yeyo’s product and brand design is positioned to tap into the premiumization of two rapidly growing categories, China’s USD $17 billion dollar yogurt market and USD $433 billion dollar snacking market. “We created this product to ride the trend of snacking premiumization that’s taking off in tier 1 cities in the health-conscious age of COVID-19,” says founder Christiana Zhu. “With very high new product development rates compared to other categories, snacking offers a great entry point for innovative new plant-based 2.0 products.”</p>
<p>The initial launch features three SKUs priced at 15RMB per 100g unit. The range includes a ‘pure’ sugar-free flavor, plus two yogurt-granola cups designed to provide a convenient and fun snack for on-the-go urbanites featuring seasonal fruit and nut granola toppings that can be added for extra flavor and nutrition.</p>
<p>Yeyo’s new commercial-scale product is a result of extensive formulation R&amp;D in partnership with globally leading ingredients company DSM. “We took onboard many learnings during the artisanal stage of our product over the past years,” says Ms Zhu. “We are proud to have created something which has tested on par or above for taste versus leading dairy yogurts during focus group sessions with our key target market.”</p>
<p>Ms Zhu first created Yeyo to address a personal need for dairy-free, sugar-free yogurt. When Yeyo organically grew into a popular local artisanal brand in Beijing, her sister Athena left her senior management post at Heineken China to help scale it together.  </p>
<p>Marvelous Foods received seed-stage investment from Lever VC to create Yeyo’s commercial product. The new product has been receiving great customer feedback and reached number 4 on Tmall’s “fastest growing chilled dairy products” list 3 weeks into launch. The company is now seeking Pre-A investment to fuel the momentum.</p>
<p>“Plant-based dairy beverage sales grew 800% on Tmall in 2020, so we believe we are in for an exciting 2021. We welcome any investors that would like to tap into this green and growing opportunity in the world’s hungriest market to get in touch.”</p>
<p><strong>About Marvelous Foods</strong></p>
<p>Marvelous Foods is a China-based company sustainably nourishing the world's hungriest market with delicious and innovative plant-powered snack foods. It aims to take on the marvelous USD $433 billion China snacking market opportunity with fun and tasty plant-based innovation upgrades.</p>
<p>Its signature product, Yeyo Coconut Yogurt, is China’s first dairy-free coconut yogurt with zero added sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners. Its Tmall store is the first-ever plant-based coconut yogurt flagship store on China’s leading e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>Led by Kiwi-Chinese sisters each with 10+ years of experience in China &amp; APAC sales and marketing, Marvelous Foods first emerged out of the founder’s personal needs for dairy-alternative foods, giving the company a unique and authentic grass-roots brand story. It has received seed-stage investment from Lever VC and is now seeking Pre-A investment to fuel the momentum from Yeyo’s commercial launch. Beyond Yeyo, the company plans to bring on other product lines, including dairy-alternative and plant-based protein snacks such as meal replacements and probiotic desserts.</p>

<li>The German FoodTech startup develops dairy alternatives made from pea protein</li>
<li>Following 400 iterations vly created an alternative using yellow split pea protein, that matches cow’s milk for nutrients, taste and functionality, and a neutral taste to attract a larger market. </li>
<li>Launched in 2020 in 25 stores, vly was stocked in over 10,000 after just 12 months. This investment will be used to drive growth in DACH and new European markets, team expansion and research and development for its new products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Berlin, Germany 20th May 2021 CEST:</strong> <a href=""https://www.vlyfoods.com/""><u>Vly</u></a>, provider of a pea-based milk alternative, has today announced an investment of €6.1M from FoodTech investors Five Seasons Ventures, alongside previous investors Global Founders Capital and Good Seed Ventures. The investment will be used to scale in DACH and new European markets, including the UK, further product development and key talent.</p>
<p>Vly was founded in 2018 by Niklas Katter, Moritz Braunwarth and Nicolas Hartmann, who saw an opportunity for a healthy milk alternative that was high in protein, low sugar, and didn’t use any ingredients associated with common allergies, such as nuts or oats. Valuing health and innovation from within the company, the co-founders also wanted the product to offer a more sustainable alternative without compromising on taste.</p>
<p>After 400 iterations in research and development, vly was created using yellow split pea protein. The finished product is neutral in taste, high in nutrients, low in sugars, and is functional, meaning it can be used for everything from frothy coffee to cereal. It’s also more sustainable, just 1L of vly uses 15x less CO2, 13x less water and 5x less land, compared to cow’s milk. </p>
<p><strong>Nicolas Hartmann, Managing Director and Co-founder of vly, commented,</strong> “From the beginning health has been a critical component of our vision for vly, experimenting with macro and micronutrients for the optimal product. We continue to invest in research and development for our products, innovating from within the company every day and staying close to the process. We have started with milk, but we want to create a range of new dairy alternative products, providing tasty and healthy options that will accelerate the plant-based shift. This funding and the industry expertise of our investors play a key part in moving us forward in this mission.”</p>
<p>Launched in Germany in January 2020 vly has experienced significant growth, scaling from the shelves of 25 stores to 10,000 after just 12 months, including major German supermarkets, such as Rewe and Edeka. Vly is already the sixth biggest plant milk brand in Germany and the company is also serving customers in Austria, Estonia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In addition to retailers and hospitality, it offers a direct-to-consumer service through its website which covers roughly 20 per cent of its business.</p>
<p>The Series A round will primarily be used to capitalise on vly’s growth to date, cementing itself in its existing markets before fuelling further expansion into international markets. The team of 15 based in Germany will be hiring across research and science, product development, marketing and sales, aiming to be 40 by the end of 2021. Vly will continue to grow its R&amp;D platform and expand into further product categories such as its chocolate drink and fermented products that will launch in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Niccolo Manzoni, Founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures</strong>, lead investor for the Series A round, added, “We scanned the entire European market for an innovative dairy alternative and decided to invest in vly because of its superior nutrition, functional profile and impressive team. In such a short period of time vly has experienced exceptional traction in the market. We see huge potential for the vly team, who are committed to making category-defining plant-based products.” </p>
<p>Vly is available for online purchase to customers in Germany and Austria, and soon further European countries. Vly’s range includes three products - Original, Unsweetened, and Barista (designed to foam better). Prices start from €2.50 per carton. </p>

<li><strong>Partnership aims to support the commercialization of Bluu Biosciences’ cell-based fish products and to facilitate access to restaurants and kitchens</strong></li>
<li><strong>Both parties are committed to creating a sustainable global food system</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Berlin, 11 May 2021. </strong>Since its successful launch in January, Delivery Hero-backed DX Ventures has focused on becoming a trusted venture capital partner for innovative technology startups across a diverse range of industries. With its investment in Bluu Biosciences as part of the company’s seed funding round, DX Ventures continues to support efforts to create a more sustainable global food system.</p>
<p>Bluu Biosciences is the first company in Europe to specialize in the development and production of cell-based fish using advanced biotechnology. Cell-based or cultivated fish is sustainable fish meat produced from real fish cells that is grown in a bioreactor. It is an animal product that, unlike wild-caught fish, is obtained without compromising animal welfare. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 90 percent of all edible fish stocks are already considered maximally exploited or overfished, while demand continues to rise as the world's population grows (source:<a href=""http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/""> </a><a href=""http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/"">FAO, 2020</a>). More and more people are relying on fish as their primary source of protein. Producing cell-based fish without harming the ecosystem and at competitive prices can make a critical contribution to global animal protein supply security in the future, as well as bringing a range of health benefits to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Brendon Blacker, Partner at DX Ventures commented:</strong> “Sustainability is at the heart of DX Ventures’ values and we are excited to support Bluu Biosciences to create a more sustainable seafood industry. We decided to partner with Bluu Biosciences after being impressed with the deep expertise of their world-class team and their clear focus on tackling the many challenges associated with the current fishing industry. We also see tremendous potential to leverage our food industry expertise to assist Bluu Biosciences with marketing its cell-based fish products to restaurants and commercial kitchens worldwide.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr Sebastian Rakers, founder and managing director of Bluu Biosciences together with Simon Fabich explained:</strong><em> </em>“With this investment from DX Ventures we have gained a long-term partner who, like us, is committed to greater sustainability in the food sector. With DX Ventures’ strong backing from Delivery Hero SE, a DAX company in Germany, we believe there are many long-term benefits to realize from our partnership. The collaboration is also an incredibly interesting opportunity for future distribution – with the potential to access thousands of great restaurants and kitchens internationally, which we see as an attractive way of accelerating our commercialization roadmap.”</p>

<p>“We have been working closely with the eniferBio team to support them and help speed up the process to receive a commercially relevant novel ingredient for the first validation at our salmon R&amp;D facilities in Norway,” says Jenna Bowyer, Category Manager Novel Ingredients, Skretting. “Our desktop assessment verified the potential of this ingredient to be an alternative protein source to marine and soy proteins in our aquafeeds. This is another example of Skretting’s commitment to identifying, developing and commercialising novel ingredients that can have a positive contribution to the sustainability of the aquaculture industry.”</p>
<p>To produce the quantity required for Skretting testing, eniferBio teamed up with Tereos, a global leader in the sugar, alcohol and starch markets. Tereos provided the raw material for the trial, in the form of vinasse, a by-product from the production of ethanol from beet molasses. The process of eniferBio allows the efficient conversion of dilute side streams such as vinasse into a valuable protein ingredient for aquaculture feed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a very important step for us as company as we re-establish the Pekilo production process, now as a major source of aquafeed protein,” says Simo Ellilä, CEO of eniferBio. “We believe the process is unique in offering a cost-competitive, sustainable alternative to soy protein concentrate. The process is very scalable, and Pekilo can be produced close to the end users – promising to decrease dependence on imported protein. This pilot trial is an excellent example of bringing together the whole value chain in Europe. It has been an absolute pleasure making this happen with the great teams at Tereos and Skretting.”</p>
<p>The Pekilo protein now continues onto salmon feeding trials at Skretting ARC, in Stavanger, Norway.</p>
<p>Last year, eniferBio was crowned the winner in the <a href=""https://www.nutreco.com/en/innovation-and-investments/competition-nftc/"">Nutreco Feed &amp; Food Tech Challenge</a>. The competition acknowledges the best breakthrough innovations within livestock farming, aquaculture and alternative food proteins, and is hosted by Nutreco, Skretting’s parent company. The grand prize included a scientific validation trial, and Skretting is excited to run the first tests with this product with the ultimate aim of commercialisation.</p>
<p>As part of Nutreco’s ambitious Sustainability RoadMap launched earlier this year, Skretting has committed to an inclusion of 5-10% ingredients from alternative novel sources by 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>We believe in seeing the world differently. The egg is the world’s most eaten animal protein, so we reimagined it. Because when we realize a plant is an egg, we eat healthier, our planet becomes healthier, and our breakfast rituals take on even more meaning. It starts with a small bean and some healthy soil. Then, the bean becomes an egg that scrambles in a pan or folds into an omelet. It leaves wild spaces wild, reduces air and ocean pollution, and builds muscle in our bodies without a milligram of cholesterol. We want to make it easier for everyone to eat well! Eating plant-based food is also the number one thing we can do for the planet. We see this reflected in the changing Chinese eating habits, which are quickly growing towards a plant-based trend.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, the Chinese government released new dietary guidelines recommending that personal meat consumption be reduced with the aim of an overall reduction of 50% by 2030. [The Guardian June 2016]</li>
<li>In a 2018 survey conducted by the New Zealand Institute of Plant and Food Research, 2000 respondents, mainly from tier-one Chinese cities, reported that they were eating less pork and poultry. On a net basis, 13.8% reported eating less pork and 6.4% percent were eating less poultry. There was also a rising net 12.5% in plant-based meats and soy product consumption. [China Briefing, August 2019]</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to this and recent health concerns post-COVID, China’s food industry is rapidly introducing plant-based innovations. The JUST Egg Plant Jianbing by Future Food Studio aims to connect and inspire the community to embrace this positive change.</p>

<p>“We want to unite the past, present, and future,” says Haofood’s CEO, Astrid Prajogo. “The past being traditional menus by dedicated chefs, the future being plant-based meat, and the present being customers’ experiences today.” The five restaurants using Haofood’s products to revitalise their cultures’ dishes are Green Friday (Xujiahui Station), Topolino (Changping Rd Station), STYX (Hengshan Rd Station), Wrap and Roll (Jiangsu Rd Station), and The Pawon (Yili Rd Station).</p>
<p>Each of Haofood’s partners brings something unique to the table. Wrap and Roll turns Haofood’s chicken into practical, tasty, and healthy food which can be incorporated into everyday life such as mini burger, wrap and bowl. Green Friday, specialising in plant-based dishes, marries popular Chinese dishes la zi ji and gong bao ji ding with peanut-based chicken made using Haofood’s products. The Pawon presents authentic Indonesian chicken dishes sate ayam, ayam rendang, and dabu-dabu grilled chicken. STYX brings to life memories of travelling through Southeast Asia with dishes from their street food scene such as chicken satay, chicken curry rice, chicken bites, and fusion tacos. Meanwhile, Topolino offers a variety of authentic Sicilan comfort foods from pizza and pasta to salads and paninis.</p>
<p>Prajogo describes one of Haofood’s aims in working with these restaurants as being part of their mission to make eating good food forever possible. “We all know eating meat is less sustainable, but it’s an important part of so many traditional menus,” she explains. “So plant-based meat is one one of the ways to preserve this, because we can continue our culinary heritage but also respect the Earth.”</p>
<p><strong>About Haofood</strong><br />
Haofood is a food science and technology startup that is making plant-based chicken, and is pioneering the usage of peanut protein as a key ingredient in plant-based meat. Based in Shanghai, Haofood was founded in 2020. With their own proprietary extrusion technology and formulation, Haofood’s chicken is safe, tasty, and nutritious.</p>",8767

<p>Mission Barns is focused on cultivating animal fat—without the animal. Its technology platform enables starting from a handful of pork, poultry, or beef cells and feeding them a plant-based feedstock inside a cultivator. Over a short period of time, the novel process creates real, pure animal fat that delivers the mouthfeel and flavor of meat without raising and slaughtering live animals, and uses a fraction of the carbon emissions, water, and land required by conventional animal agriculture.</p>
<p>The first commercial application of Mission Fat is in plant-based meat. Consumers repeatedly cite flavor, mouthfeel, and meatiness as the leading hurdles to regularly purchasing plant-based meat products. CEO Eitan Fischer said: “Time and again, we see that the addition of Mission Fat to plant proteins makes alternative meat products in any number of categories far outperform the incumbent plant-based options.”</p>
<p>The company has developed products incorporating Mission Fat in various categories both on its own and through collaboration with leading meat companies and plant protein partners. Applications include: bacon, breakfast patties, burgers, nuggets, dumplings, hot dogs, poultry sausages, meatballs, and more.</p>
<p>The Series A funding will be used to scale up and commercialize its Mission Fat technology. Global food and agriculture investors participated in the round, including Lever VC; Gullspang Re:Food (Oatly); Humboldt Fund (NotCo &amp; Geltor); Green Monday Ventures (Beyond Meat &amp; Perfect Day); Enfini Ventures (Impossible Foods &amp; Memphis Meats); and a European meat company. Other investors in the round included Blue Ledge Capital; Prithvi Ventures; and Joyance Partners.</p>
<p>A number of Seed investors increased their stake in the company including Global Founders Capital (Facebook &amp; LinkedIn); Point Nine Capital (Delivery Hero); Better Ventures; and Cantos Ventures.</p>
<p>Nick Cooney, Managing Partner of Lever VC, said: ""I've been sampling plant-based meats for 20 years from a huge variety of brands globally, and have never tasted anything as meat-like as products containing Mission Fat. This is going to be a game-changer for the alternative meat sector, because it's going to help brands around the world have a dramatically better product almost overnight.”</p>
<p>Mission Barns’ team includes senior biotechnology experts from Genentech &amp; Sigma-Aldrich; culinary leaders from Michelin-starred The French Laundry &amp; Thomas Keller Restaurant Group; and veterans from other cellular agriculture companies including JUST &amp; Memphis Meats.</p>
<p>The company has been growing quickly and is actively looking for passionate team members who want to be on the forefront of revolutionizing the global food system. A large number of technical and non-technical roles can be found on its careers page: <a href=""https://missionbarns.com/careers/"">MissionBarns.com/Careers</a></p>

<p>The new membership group provides a forum for Australia’s alternative proteins sector to explore common issues and opportunities and aims to ensure the sector’s collective voice remains strong and unified on key issues as it evolves.</p>
<p>Australia’s independent think tank and expert advisor on alternative proteins, Food Frontier, is also a founding member of the APC and will act as secretariat. Additional alternative protein companies are anticipated to join in coming months, a reflection of the industry’s recent growth.</p>
<p>Deloitte Access Economics (DAE) modelling in Food Frontier’s 2020 State of the Industry valued the Australian plant-based meat industry, one portion of the broader alternative proteins sector, at $185 million in sales, following a 46 percent increase in grocery sales and doubling of products on shelves in FY20. DAE’s FY19 growth modelling forecasts the domestic industry to reach almost $3 billion in sales by 2030, in a moderate scenario.</p>
<p>Food Frontier’s Director of Policy and Government Relations Sam Lawrence said establishing the APC marks an evolution in Australia’s alternative proteins sector. He noted the importance of a unified voice on matters of common interest, such as the recent working group initiated by the Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud through the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to review plant-based product labelling.</p>
<p>Mr Lawrence said, “The plant-based meat sector has taken a collaborative and evidence-based approach to best serve the interests of consumers around issues including product labelling. The APC formalises our collaboration to support the 29 companies comprising Australia’s alternative proteins sector to engage at a national level on policy issues, enabling the sector’s shared vision and continuing to serve Australians who enjoy alternative protein products.”</p>
<p><strong>About Food Frontier</strong><br />
Food Frontier is the independent think tank and expert advisor on alternative proteins in Australia and New Zealand. Our work illuminates the economic, environmental and public health benefits of alternative proteins and enables leaders to understand and pursue opportunities in the emerging plant-based meat and cellular agriculture industries. As an educator and facilitator at the centre of Australia and New Zealand’s alternative proteins ecosystem, we engage businesses, innovators and policymakers – from start-ups to grocery giants, farming bodies to regulators - through reports, conversations and events.</p>

Bluu Biosciences is the first company in Europe to specialize in the development and production of cell-based fish.","<p><strong>Berlin, March 26th, 2021.</strong> Berlin-based biotech startup Bluu Biosciences has closed its seed funding round at 7 million euros less than ten months after its foundation. Bluu Biosciences is the first company in Europe to specialize in the development and production of cell-based fish. There is currently only a hand full of other companies active in this field worldwide. Leading global food and impact investors such as Manta Ray Ventures (UK), CPT Capital (UK), Lever VC (USA), Norrsken (SE) and Be8 (GER) participated in the investment round. The fresh capital will flow into the company's intensive biotechnology research and development work as well as into product development. The founding of Bluu Biosciences was supported by the Berlin-based company builder EVIG, which specializes in working with scientists to build biotechnology start-ups in the food sector.</p>
<p>“We are proud that we could partner with investors such as Manta Ray, CPT, Lever, and more, that believe in the importance of deep innovation for the aim of a more sustainable food system,” explained Dr Sebastian Rakers, co-founder and managing director of Bluu Biosciences. “The round was closed in a matter of weeks, which indicates how compelling the science team and the science foundation of Bluu is. It also showcases the incredible interest of great investors to support this kind of initiative,” Simon Fabich, Co-Founder and managing director, added. The Cultivated Meat sector, where there are already initial approvals for cultivated meat products in Singapore, is fuelling the prospects for a similarly positive development in cell-based fish products.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivated Fish – sustainable protein source for future supply security</strong></p>
<p>Cell-based or cultivated fish is sustainable fish meat produced from fish cells that is grown in a bioreactor. It is an animal product that, unlike wild-caught fish, is obtained without compromising animal welfare. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 90 percent of all edible fish stocks are already considered maximally exploited or overfished, while demand continues to rise as the world's population grows (source: <a href=""http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/"">FAO, 2020</a>). More and more people are relying on fish as their primary source of protein. Producing cell-based fish without harming the ecosystem and at competitive prices can make a critical contribution to global animal protein supply security in the future. ""Cultivated fish has the potential to feed a large portion of humanity. Our task is to rapidly operationalize the findings from biotechnological research to leverage this potential,” emphasized Sebastian Rakers.</p>
<p>Other advantages of cultivated fish include its high nutritional value, the absence of pollutants, its availability even in places without access to the sea and the associated short supply chains. The production process is resource-friendly and has a significantly lower CO2 footprint as well as water and energy consumption compared to the conventional fish processing industry. Moreover, cell-based fish is the answer to industrial fish farming, as it will be able to save trillions of fish lives.</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development at the highest level</strong></p>
<p>“Bluu Biosciences has set out to produce tasty and nutrient-optimized fish products from fish cells that are free of genetic engineering, antibiotics and environmental toxins,"" said Rakers. “Above all, that means intensive research and development work to develop the optimal fish cell lines for subsequent production. Bluu is in the excellent position of using proprietary technologies and non-gmo immortalized cell lines to achieve that.” Bluu Biosciences cooperates closely with the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Marine Biotechnology and Cell Engineering (EMB) in Lübeck in this endeavour and has a state-of-the-art R&amp;D environment at its disposal. Further partnerships for nutrient media optimization and bioreactor development are planned.</p>

<p>The New, one of Latin America’s fastest-growing plant-based meat brands, announced today it has secured funding from Lever VC, a leading global investor in the alternative protein space, and Paulo Veras, Founder and CEO of 99, Brazil’s first tech unicorn. Funding will be used to complete expansion of a 1,000 square meter production facility amid heavy demand for the company’s products at national and regional retailers.</p>
<p>Launched in September 2019 by plant-based triathlete and successful entrepreneur Bruno Fonseca, The New produces plant-based salmon, cod, chicken, and beef products. All products are non-GMO and free of all common allergens including soy and gluten, positioning The New alongside Beyond Meat as one of the only high-quality plant-based meat brands free of these two common allergens. The company has already grown to over 700 points of sale in its first 18 months of operation, including placement at Brazil’s two largest retail chains Pao de Acucar and CarreFour.</p>
<p>“Since 2017 we have been researching and developing our products with the goal of offering something more delicious and cleaner than everything else in the Brazilian market today,” said Bruno Fonseca, CEO and founder of The New. “For example, we do not use hydrogenated palm fat, choosing instead to use natural coconut fat, which when combined with pea protein has an incredible flavor.”</p>
<p>That flavor has caught the attention of consumers seeking a healthier and more sustainable diet, as well as leading supermarket chains. Brazilian retail leader Pão de Açucar, one of The New’s key accounts, reported that plant-based burgers accounted for 30% of all hamburger sales at its stores last year.</p>
<p>""We are incredibly excited to be partnered with The New,"" said Nick Cooney, Managing Partner at global alternative protein fund Lever VC, whose partners were early backers of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. ""When we carried out consumer taste panels of plant-based meat brands in Brazil, over 90% liked The New's products best, and by a very wide margin. We love their products, their team, their commitment to R&amp;D and continuous improvement, and their fast sales growth. Plant-based meat is beginning to boom in Latin America, and we think The New will be a clear category leader.""</p>
<p>For angel investor Paulo Veras, who founded and ran Brazil’s first tech unicorn, ridehailing app 99, The New is where food meets tech. “The New is spearheading the food revolution.

<p>Retail sales surged 46 percent in the year to June 2020, with the number of new jobs more than doubling (106 percent growth) in the emerging sector, and manufacturing revenues increasing from $35 million to nearly $70 million.</p>

<p>The report by Food Frontier, Australia’s independent think tank on alternative proteins, further reveals that national retailers doubled the number of plant-based meat products on Australian grocery shelves last year to more than 200. This expansion of plant-based meat product ranges caters to growing consumer interest, as evidenced by the one-third of Australians who are limiting their meat consumption.<sup>i</sup></p>

<p>Growing demand for meat alternatives being driven foremost by health concerns, which the report notes are expected to rise further post-pandemic.<sup>ii</sup></p>

<p>At the same time, global investment in plant-based meat in 2020 reflected this rising demand, with US$1.5 billion pouring in from international meat and FMCG giants, governments and venture capitalists.</p>

<p>Deloitte Access Economics’ 2019 modelling for Food Frontier forecast that consumer sales in Australia’s plant-based meat sector could hit $3 billion annually by 2030, from its FY20 level of $185 million – and create over 6,000 new jobs.</p>

<p>But Food Frontier CEO Thomas King says governments at all levels need to support investment in R&amp;D and infrastructure for the burgeoning industry, as well as evidenced-based regulation to ensure a level playing field for new players in the market.</p>

<p>“With the right political will, Australia can build a multi-billion-dollar plant-based meat industry, enabling our food businesses and farmers to capitalise on fast-growing global demand for alternative proteins.”</p>

<p>Plant-based meats are forecast to command 10 percent of the US$1.4 trillion global meat market by 2029 according to Barclays,<sup>iii</sup> as the growing category of consumers dubbed ‘flexitarians’ choose meat alternatives more often.</p>

<p>According to recent reports, much of that growth will be in Asia – where consumer demand for alternatives like plant-based mince, poultry-style and pork-style products is expected to grow 200 percent over the next five years in China and Thailand alone.<sup>iv</sup></p>

<p>“Australia’s plant-based meat companies are eyeing export opportunities and will be watching demand trends overseas closely, while some, including Fable Food Co, Fenn Foods and v2food, have already launched into Singapore, Japan, Korea and other Asian markets,” said King.</p>

<p>“Australia has the agricultural capacity, commercial appetite and research know-how to become an international leader in new protein industries including plant-based meat. To not make the early investments necessary to leverage these unique strengths would be a missed opportunity.”</p>

<p><strong>Additional points from Food Frontier’s 2020 State of the Industry report:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of Australian plant-based meat brands almost doubled from 10 to 19 in major retail and national foodservice outlets (supermarkets, restaurants and fast-food outlets) in FY20.</li>
	<li>Amidst the pandemic, Australian plant-based meat companies pivoted where necessary to achieve expansion plans. For example, amid dining closures Fable Food Co and v2food transitioned to home meal delivery through partnerships with local restaurants and Deliveroo, respectively; v2food paired deliveries with trial packs of its retail products.</li>
	<li>Australian foodservice sales were down 10 per cent due to the pandemic, including sales of plant-based meat. Given new plant-based meat products were introduced to menus just before pandemic-induced lockdowns, this sales channel has potential for considerable growth in 2021 and beyond.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The opportunity for Australia</strong><br />
Sector-wide interventions that will enable the plant-based meat sector to continue its upward trajectory, benefiting consumers, food businesses and crop farmers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>State governments can bring jobs to their region and enable Australian farmers to generate more profit at the farmgate by supporting investments in the infrastructure necessary to process Australian crops into the ingredients used in plant-based meats.</li>
	<li>Federal government can support R&amp;D that generates plant protein intellectual property, which will help to establish Australia as a global centre for alternative proteins and contribute to the nation’s goal of a $100 billion food and fibre sector by 2030.</li>
	<li>Retailers can further growth in the plant-based meat category by supplying options that satisfy consumer tastes at more competitive prices and providing promotional support.</li>

<li>After an investment of €3.5 million, the factory will start to produce plant-based foods this Spring.</li>
<li>The plant has been constructed with sustainable materials and techniques and uses only green energy. Initial annual production capacity is one million kilos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seva (Osona), 1st March 2020.- </strong><a href=""https://zyrcularfoods.com/""><strong>Zyrcular Foods</strong></a><strong>,</strong> a company devoted to the sustainable production and distribution of foods based on plant protein, has started production at an alternative protein plant in the town of Seva, in the Osona region of Barcelona province.</p>
<p>The company has invested a total of €3.5 million in the 1,500 square metre facility. Operating initially with a single shift, Zyrcular Foods will produce up to 1,000,000 kilograms annually of alternative protein for third parties, supermarket chains, foodservice companies and food manufacturers.</p>
<p>The plant is currently in commissioning and will start production in mid-March. It will be the <strong>first factory 100% dedicated to alternative protein production </strong>in Spain. Zyrcular Foods has also acquired adjacent plots with a view to expanding production of plant protein and other alternative protein foods in the medium and long term. </p>
<p><strong>Launch pad for startups and international businesses</strong></p>
<p>As part of the Netherlands’ Wageningen Food Valley food cluster and the Good Food Institute (which started in the United States and is now active worldwide), Zyrcular Foods will offer its facility in Seva to startups and foodtech businesses from Spain and other countries to produce and sell their products in Europe. Many businesses will be able to reduce their carbon footprint by using the new facility to produce in the Mediterranean region rather than importing their products.   </p>
<p><strong>A sustainable business for a greener world</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is one of the foundations of the project, consistent with the company’s business goals. That is why the plant is 100% green: it operates with renewable on-site solar energy and energy supplied by PEUSA (a renewable energy supplier that operates in the Pyrenees).</p>
<p>The project’s financing is also structured following the principles of sustainable finance. The plant is certified under the internationally recognised ISO 14001 environmental management standard and is practically emissions neutral. The facility is at the entry to the Biosphere Reserve of the Montseny Natural Park and its design respects the natural environment.   </p>
<p><strong>“Our dream must be to produce using locally grown plant raw material: that would enable us to bring our CO2 footprint down as low as possible,” </strong>said Santiago Aliaga, Zyrcular Foods’ CEO, who went on to add <strong>“we will encourage growers to shift to new legume crops and help to counteract rural depopulation through a value-added project.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>A system open for use by other businesses</strong></p>
<p>The Zyrcular Foods group is made up of three businesses or business units: Zyrcular Labs, Zyrcular Plant and Zyrcular Brands. Zyrcular Labs is involved in innovation and food development; Zyrcular Plant – the new factory – is devoted to manufacturing; and Zyrcular Brands works on product distribution. With this open system, Zyrcular Foods offers its services to businesses that need to develop new foods, that need to manufacture at scale or that need a distribution arm to reach the retail or foodservice markets in Spain.   </p>
<p>Aliaga affirms that <strong>“we have gone from being a distributor of big international plant protein brands like Beyond Meat, NEXT, Gardein and Sophie’s Kitchen to producing them under contract. This is a significant milestone for innovation in the food industry in Spain.”</strong></p>
<p>The company currently distributes leading international alternative protein brands like Beyond Meat, NEXT!, Gardein, Sophie’s Kitchen and Green Vie. The business is a supplier for big supermarket chains like ALDI, La Sirena, Sánchez-Romero, and foodservice companies like Áreas, Pad Thai Wok and Fosters Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>About Zyrcular Foods</strong></p>

<li>Demand has already quadrupled within Blackbird’s home region of the northeast since the start of 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>New York, NY February 18, 2020. -- Blackbird Foods Inc., the plant-based foods startup, has just announced its first close of a $1.5 million seed round to grow the distribution of its wheat-based protein products and hand-tossed frozen pizzas. In December 2020, Blackbird expanded to the West Coast by launching at Erewhon, its first chain outside of the Northeast region. It has plans to start rolling out into more grocery chains nationwide in 2021.</p>
<p>Before securing its first seed round, CEO Emanuel Storch says that Blackbird had to quadruple the output of its retail products in 2020 due to the demand shift seen after the outbreak of COVID19. “Before the pandemic, our core business was selling to restaurants. I quickly realized that we had to pivot in order to meet the demands of consumers. I built an eCommerce site overnight on Squarespace and partnered with grocery distributors in New York to bring our products to more shelves,” says Storch.</p>
<p>As sales started to grow month over month, Blackbird sought investment from mission-driven investors like Lever VC, a Venture Capital firm dedicated to alternative protein, and Sustainable Food Ventures led by Ryan Bethencourt, founder of Wild Earth, a plant-based dog food company featured on Shark Tank.“ The face of protein is changing. Sales of plant-based meat and dairy products are soaring. We are excited to bring these investors onboard at Blackbird, as the company demonstrably shows how plant-based foods can be even better than their animal-based counterparts with no sacrifice on flavor, texture, or even nutrition,” adds Storch.</p>
<p>Blackbird has been recognized by renowned chefs like Guy Vaknin of Beyond Sushi and Mathieu Palombino, Chef and owner of Motorino Pizzeria. Motorino helped develop and uses Blackbird’s plant-based sausage as a pizza topping at all its locations. Chef Guy uses Blackbird’s seitan in multiple dishes including a take on steak frites at his new spot ‘Willow’ in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>
<p>All of this traction helped Blackbird get noticed by major retailers like Whole Foods, Erewhon Central Market, Harmons, and Metropolitan Markets, in which the company plans to start rolling out this Spring.</p>",8465

<li>Hoxton Farms wants to ‘bring back fat’ and unlock a new kind of meat replacement that blends plant-based and cultivated ingredients</li>
<li>The investment round, led by Founders Fund, alongside Backed, Presight Capital, CPT Capital and Sustainable Food Ventures, will be used to develop its scalable production platform and build key talent in its research and development team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>London, UK 9th February 2021</strong>: <a href=""https://hoxtonfarms.com/""><u>Hoxton Farms</u></a> has announced a £2.7 million seed round to cultivate animal fat and solve an urgent issue for the rapidly growing meat alternatives market. Its approach delivers the missing ingredient necessary to make meat alternatives delicious, realistic and versatile: fat.</p>
<p>For decades, the food industry has faced the challenge of finding effective, low-cost and sustainable replacements for traditional animal fat, the most important sensory ingredient in meat. Fat defines how meat looks, cooks, and tastes – and it does this in a way that cannot be replicated by plant oils currently used in meat alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Max Jamilly, Co-Founder of Hoxton Farms, said</strong>, “We want to bring back fat: it’s the single most important ingredient in the meat that we eat. The technology we’re developing will allow us to customise fat for any application – and we’re making it healthier too. Cultivated fat is the hero ingredient for meat alternatives, and it will solve a huge problem in this growing industry. We believe the future of meat alternatives will be a blend of plant-based protein and cultivated fat.”</p>
<p>Animal agriculture is responsible for almost 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and uses 30 per cent of habitable land and freshwater. Demand for plant-based meat has grown 125 per cent in the last two years, and according to Fortune Business Insights, the global meat substitute market is expected to be worth $8.15Bn by 2026. But there’s a big fat problem.</p>
<p>Existing meat alternatives contain plant oils as a substitute for animal fat, but these oils have an enormous environmental impact and make plant-based meat greasy and unpalatable. Hoxton Farms is working to solve this problem using cultivated fat that is ethical and sustainable without compromising taste and performance.</p>
<p>Starting with a tiny sample of animal cells, Hoxton Farms grows purified animal fat in cultivators, much like the fermentors used for brewing beer. This process is, however, expensive and difficult to scale. The startup is solving this by using proprietary computational models to reduce the cost.</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steele, Co-Founder of Hoxton Farms, commented, </strong>“Our mathematical approach drives everything we do at Hoxton Farms. We simulate the entire process computationally, from biopsy to bacon. This “digital twin” allows us to optimise every raw input in parallel, massively improving the cost-efficiency and performance of our cultivated fat for our customers.”</p>
<p>Hoxton Farms’ co-founders, Dr Max Jamilly, a synthetic biologist and formerly part of Legendairy Foods, and Ed Steele, a mathematician and former machine learning engineer at Thought Machine, met at nursery school over 25 years ago and have been friends ever since. They teamed up in 2020 to combine their expertise and build Hoxton Farms against the backdrop of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Steele continued,</strong> “The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the fragility of traditional meat supply chains and the risks they pose to human health and the environment. We wanted to bring together our skills to address a pressing problem: how to satisfy a growing demand for meat without compromising on health, sustainability or animal ethics.“</p>
<p>Hoxton Farms has received investment from leading Silicon Valley VC Founders Fund, founded by Peter Thiel, alongside Backed, Presight Capital, CPT Capital, Sustainable Food Ventures, and angel investors.</p>
<p>Hoxton Farms will use this seed investment to develop a proof of concept of its production platform and build customer partnerships, helping the startup to achieve its goal of supplying cultivated fat to the global meat alternatives industry.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Scott, Principal at Founders Fund, added,</strong> “The market for plant-based meat has exploded in recent years, especially during the pandemic. But plant-based meat has a long way to go – and that’s because it’s missing out on real cell-based animal fat. The team’s ability to tailor the precise sensory and functional properties of fat allows them to produce exactly what their customers need. Hoxton Farms has the potential to change an industry.”</p>
<p>In the coming months, the startup will begin work at its new R&amp;D lab in Hoxton, London, and continue to grow its talented team of biologists and mathematicians.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Brunicki, Partner at Backed, added, </strong><em>“</em>We’re excited to invest in Hoxton Farms and its talented team. Ed and Max are taking a pioneering approach to drive down the cost of cellular agriculture by combining their unique expertise in mathematical optimisation, machine learning and gene regulatory networks. Hoxton Farms is building a unique platform that will not only deliver cost reducing solutions that have been out of reach for many other players in the space, but also provide the flexibility to deliver unique cellular and sensory characteristics at speed.”</p>

<p><strong>Shanghai</strong> — HERO Protein, the first domestic plant-based meat company in China to use cutting-edge high-moisture extrusion technology, announced today that it has completed a US$850K pre-seed funding round to launch its products into the market. The funding round saw participation from Cremer, a leading global commodities and co-manufacturing company; Lever China Fund, the most active alternative protein investor in China; and senior executives from leading restaurant brands.</p>
<p>HERO Protein’s initial product range, which includes a variety of plant-based beef and chicken products, was formulated specifically for the Chinese market by a team of former senior R&amp;D executives at Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Gardein, Lightlife and Morningstar, the five largest plant-based meat brands in North America. The application of high moisture extrusion technology, which is common in the west but to date has not been used by domestic brands in China, is particularly critical for reproducing the juiciness and mouthfeel of meat.</p>
<p>The funding round will be used to advance the company’s ongoing research and development, to develop and scale production, and to expand distribution. HERO Protein launched into the foodservice channel in China in January.</p>
<p><em>""Plant-based meat is a rising and unstoppable trend in China,""</em> said HERO Protein CEO Edward Weng, who for the past fifteen years served as VP of Sales and Marketing at Xiamen Zhongma, selling conventional meat and other food products into leading QSR chains in China including KFC, Starbucks and Burger King. ""<em>HERO Protein aims to bring together the advanced food technology used by top international players such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods and the domestic know-how to curate delicious products specifically catered to the Chinese palate, at prices affordable for a broader range of Chinese consumers. We are very pleased to receive support from investors and partners who share our mission.""</em></p>
<p><em>""HERO Protein is proud to partner with leading domestic players in the ingredients, logistics, production, food and retail industries,""</em> said HERO Protein COO Ludovic Shum, who previously worked as Marketing Director at Carrefour China in charge of category management and new concepts development, with 15 years of experience in the retail industry at Carrefour France and China. <em>""By localizing the production we ensure product quality control and keep pricing affordable, allowing for successful market penetration and growth.""</em></p>
<p>HERO Protein is the first domestic company in China to sell plant-based meat products produced using high-moisture extrusion. Founded in 2020 and based in Shanghai, HERO Protein aims to become the leading brand delivering a tasty and accessible range of plant-based meat products, offering consumers the culinary experience of conventional meat while ensuring food safety and sustainability. HERO Protein was recently named to the International Future Agrifood 2020 Alternative Protein Top 20 list, and was a winner of TechNode Global’s 2020 ORIGIN Innovation Awards in the Food &amp; AgriTech category.</p>

<p>By becoming the go-to place for process development and scale-up of novel foods, feeds and nutraceuticals, this will help to drive both CPI and the Tees Valley as leaders in biomanufacturing and food innovation. The investment from the Tees Valley Combined Authority builds on recent investments from CPI to create food grade precision fermentation and pilot plant capabilities at the Wilton Centre in Redcar.</p>
<p>Increasing global demands for food, along with growing health, environmental and animal welfare concerns are driving emerging trends in the food, feed and nutraceutical markets. However, in order to keep up with ever-changing consumer demands and drive innovation across the product supply chain, specialised facilities, technical expertise and advanced capabilities are needed.</p>
<p>To continue responding to this market need, CPI will extend its current capabilities at the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility in Wilton, Redcar with this funding, upgrading its laboratories and technical development areas and establishing new food-grade capabilities. This cutting-edge Centre of Excellence will enable CPI to support businesses in developing new and improved food products, ultimately creating new products and biomanufacturing jobs in the region. The facility update will enable CPI to provide exemplar services, samples and collaboration to recognised Food Safety and Quality Standards (FSSC 22000).</p>
<p>The new Centre of Excellence will leverage at least an additional £20-30 million from industry over the next five years by attracting new businesses to the Tees Valley; initially to work with CPI in the new facilities, but hopefully in time to establish themselves in the region.</p>
<p>Through CPI’s unique set of capabilities in the North East, the Centre of Excellence will be able to integrate a variety of technologies from ingredient production through to formulation and packaging solutions to deliver the sustainable food supply chain demanded by consumers in the 21st Century. Within the innovation supply chain CPI will provide connectivity, linking partners and collaborators from its global network.</p>
<p>Frank Millar, CEO at CPI, said: “We are delighted to be building on CPI’s current capabilities in the food, feed and nutraceuticals market through the development of this new Centre of Excellence. With this investment from the Tees Valley Combined Authority, in conjunction with CPI’s investment programme and the commitment of industry partners, the Novel Food, Feed and Nutraceuticals Innovation Centre of Excellence places the Tees Valley at the heart of a more sustainable food industry.”</p>
<p>Kris Wadrop, General Manager for Biotechnology at CPI, said: “This unique capability in Teesside will draw companies from all of the UK, EU and even the world to Wilton. Ultimately, this new centre will enable businesses to demonstrate technologies and develop products that could transform our food, feed and nutraceuticals.”</p>

<p>CellulaREvolution, a spin out from Newcastle University, was founded in 2019 by Martina Miotto, Che Connon and Leo Groenewegen. It is developing ground-breaking technologies to make the culturing of cells more efficient and affordable. The process is based on the novel concept of a continuous cell culturing system which has a higher yield, smaller footprint and lower input requirements than traditional batch technologies. Alex Buchan, Investment Director at Northstar Ventures, said:</p>
<p>""<em>We are delighted to continue supporting CellulaREvolution, not only are we very impressed with the team, they have a clearly identified market opportunity and a ground breaking, scalable solution. They are developing a technology which could be fundamental to the economics of production, and a real game changer. It also demonstrates the innovation and ambition that is prevalent in spin outs here in the North East.</em>""</p>
<p>To date, CellulaREvolution has identified potential benefits from their technologies within the medical and pharmaceutical industries, especially when looking at the production of cell-based therapies, blood products or viral vectors.</p>
<p>Most importantly, CellulaREvolution also sees opportunities across the cultivated meat industry. Cultivated meat producers are focused on disrupting traditional agriculture by providing a suitable alternative to slaughtered meat. The technologies that CellulaREvolution produces will enable this industry to produce at real scale and at affordable cost contributing to far reaching environmental and ethical benefits.</p>
<p>Leo Groenewegen CEO of CellulaREvolution said, “<em>The investment is a clear sign that investors both understand and believe the technological advantage our future products will have over others in this rapidly expanding market. We are now ready and equipped to accelerate the development of our products and make a true innovative impact on the way cells are grown!</em>”</p>
<p>Most notable is the commitment made by CPT Capital who are an expert investor in the alternative protein space and were early investors in the world’s leading cultivated meat producers, for instance; Memphis Meats, Aleph Farms and BlueNalu. “<em>CPT Capital are genuinely excited to be able to support CellulaREvolution in this financing round. The work that they are doing is of critical importance in establishing cultivated meat as a realistic, viable and attractive alternative to factory farming in meeting the world’s growing demand for food,</em>” the company said.</p>
<p>David Huntley, Head of Company Creation at Newcastle University and its project lead for Northern Accelerator, said: “<em>This investment in CellulaREvolution is a clear example of the strength of our university spin-outs, with the company already making great strides as a change-maker in its industry. It is a highly investible business with an exciting future ahead. With Northern Accelerator support, a strong management team has been formed, bringing an industry-experienced CEO together with the founding academics, to create a business that will realise a significant impact as it takes ground-breaking research from the lab to the world.</em>”</p>

(“Nabati”), launched its plant-based meat line this month on November 3, and the products are expected to be in stores by January of 2021.</p>
<p>This plant-based meat line is also planned to launch in the U.S. in Q1 of 2021, in time for category resets in retail stores that take place in March and April.</p>
<p>“Our Nabati burger is very different than a lot of what we are seeing on the market today,” said Ahmad Yeyah, CEO of Nabati. “We are developing a plant-based chicken burger instead of a red meat burger, and it is also unbreaded. This differentiates our product from what is in the market and ultimately improves the experience that the customer has with the product - because they have the freedom to choose how they want to enjoy it - with or without breading. We also provide recipes if the customer wants to bread the product themselves, or they can enjoy it as-is to save on calories. This all contributes to creating the best possible experience for those who enjoy our products. We have also added a plant-based fish burger to this line, which is also not something you typically see.”</p>
<p>Nabati is a private food technology company that offers healthy, plant-based products. Nabati is based in Edmonton, Alberta, and serves the North American Market. All products are certified gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, refined sugar-free, all natural (non-GMO), certified kosher, and certified vegan.</p>
<p>“My wife and I started the company in 2014, two years after we moved to Alberta, after deciding that we were simply not satisfied with the variety of plant-based foods available in store - especially desserts,” added Yehya. “We then began developing our own recipes at home, and sharing them with friends and family, and eventually we took them to the farmer’s market, where the products were very well received. We started this business with $33,000 and now we have our products in stores across North America.”</p>
<p>Demand for the products has been growing steadily, and sales grew organically by over 33% in Canada in just the past year, largely from Nabati’s dairy-free cheesecakes and Nabati Cheeze Shreds. Nabati’s dairy-free cheesecakes have just begun selling in the U.S. this fall, and 2021 will see Nabati expanding its production facility as well as its popular Nabati Cheeze line, introducing cheese slices. Demand for the cheese products has been enormous and the company plans to not only expand distribution across the U.S. but also throughout Asia and Europe in 2022.</p>
<p>“The company has grown up to this point almost completely organically by word of mouth,” said Patrick Morris, CEO of Eat Beyond. “We are thrilled to partner with Nabati to further drive this growth, expand the company’s market share and grow its product lines to serve this rapidly expanding market not just in North America, but also across the globe. Nabati plans to diversify its revenue sources through new products and distribution and quickly reach its (conservative) revenue target of $7M by 2023.”</p>

<p><strong>New York microalgae company closes capital raise via Harvest Returns platform</strong></p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas, November 17, 2020 – Brooklyn, New York-based We Are The New Farmers, Inc. announced today that it has successfully completed a pre-seed round totaling $335,000 on the Harvest Returns agriculture crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>We Are The New Farmers is a controlled-environment agriculture company that produces spirulina microalgae, one of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet. The climate change and disaster resilient technology the farm utilizes is unparalleled in sustainability and cost-efficiency. The company plans to use the capital raised to build a new facility to increase their production.</p>
<p>“We believe that microalgae will be an integral part of the solution that we need to fix our food system,” said Jonas Guenther, co-founder of We Are The New Farmers. “Cultivation of microalgae is incredibly resilient and only needs a fraction of the resources compared to more traditional crops. Our mission is to unlock the powers of microalgae, establishing it as a building block of a circular food system. We are incredibly excited to be the first successful microalgae farm on Harvest Returns, who have been extremely valuable partners on our fundraising journey. Thanks to Harvest Returns, we are one step closer to achieving our mission.”</p>
<p>We Are The New Farmers sells fresh spirulina online and in select local grocery stores. The company has recently expanded to being the first and only company to offer frozen spirulina cubes in retail. The conveniently pre-portioned cubes are flash-frozen at peak freshness with significantly higher bio-availability of nutrients than dried powder and offer a better flavor profile. One cube is equal to a full day’s fresh greens, and two cubes provide the same amount of protein as a chicken egg.</p>
<p>“Alternative proteins have been extremely popular with investors this year and we’re pleased to be working with such an innovative company on the cutting edge of that space,” said Chris Rawley, CEO of Harvest Returns. “We Are The New Farmers is producing a unique superfood that will have increasing appeal to consumers.”</p>
<p><strong>About Harvest Returns</strong></p>
<p>Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Harvest Returns, Inc. is a financial technology marketplace created in 2016 by two military veterans to bring agricultural producers together with investors. Through democratizing the agriculture investment process, the online platform provides curated, diversified offerings of farms, ranches, and agribusinesses to qualified investors.</p>

<p><strong>Naas, Ireland, November 13, 2020</strong> — Kerry, the Taste &amp; Nutrition company, is pleased to release a research white paper on the exciting emerging topic of protein snack bar development and manufacture. Entitled “<strong>Choosing the Right Protein for Your Snack Bar</strong><em>,” </em>the paper examines the rapidly expanding market for snack bars that provide a quality hit of protein and a wide variety of new tastes. In addition, the paper reviews the latest trends in consumer preference in the area of ingredients and bar tastes, important trends and regional regulations in formulation, and the application of plant, dairy and mixed protein in new bar concepts.</p>
<p>“Snackification” — the movement toward snacking versus eating distinct meals — had already been on the rise prior to COVID-19, leading consumers to begin paying much more attention to the nutritional value of snacks. Since the onset of the pandemic, however, consumers have naturally started to feel more vulnerable; this in turn has accelerated a desire to incorporate more healthier foods into their diets as a means to support long-term health goals. Throughout this pandemic, we’ve seen the public rushing to stock up on snacks, whether for a quick and convenient source of nutrition or to provide comfort during these highly challenging times.</p>
<p>Breaking it down further, the appeal of protein specifically — an important nutritional element in health and wellness — has led sales of snack bars with “high” or “added” protein claims to grow exponentially as a category: in 2019 alone, the sector was valued at a remarkable US$6 billion. Globally, snack bar launches featuring high/added protein have moved from 17% in 2015 to 33% in 2019.</p>
<p>“We believe the upward trend in demand for protein-fortified snacks will continue over the long term, driven by rejuvenated consumer interest in healthy eating and underpinned by dynamic innovation in the category. With new sources of protein being discovered continually and new tastes/delivery formats constantly being innovated, snack bars’ fortunes have taken a noticeable turn upward,” says Mindy Leveille, Strategic Marketing Manager – Proteins, Kerry.</p>
<p>“Sales of snack bars with high/added protein claims continue to rise as consumers respond to a ‘feel good’ factor around purchasing snacks that pack an added nutritional punch,” adds Leveille. “Consumers everywhere recognize the value of protein in snack-size portions, and protein-added snack bars are a quick and convenient way for busy people to get a tasty nutrition boost. Our R&amp;D white paper provides a treasure trove of information designed to assist bar manufacturers as they search for just the right protein for their snack bar formulations.”</p>
<p><strong>Key considerations for complex bar challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of considerations for bar product development to keep top of mind: consumers want alternative plant protein sources; also, there is a growing trend toward “flexitarian” proteins bars — hybrids that incorporate both plant and animal protein. While sustainability in manufacturing is certainly valued, according to Mintel, it is also a fact that as many as 75% of consumers believe taste is the <em>most important</em> <em>factor</em> when purchasing a protein product. This is a concern for high-protein content bars, as surveys have revealed that those with health claims are less likely to be perceived as “good tasting” versus comparable products without such assertions.</p>
<p>“There are many emerging ingredients and flavors to apply in protein snack bars, ranging from coffee cold brew to mango to tomato &amp; basil, with the latter being a savory alternative to sweet cereal bars,” said Leveille. “Our white paper presents a number of protein bar concepts to provide inspiration to bar developers for their next new product development.”</p>
<p>Having a clean label is another important concern for consumers, and the advent of new and alternative proteins heralds an opportunity for snack bar manufacturers to innovate and benefit by adopting simpler, clean label formulations. This is especially important for protein bars with high sugar content or those that have been highly processed. Brands are now being pressured to reformulate with simpler ingredients, and to be more transparent about on-pack information.

A significant part of the problem is the lack of sustainably produced protein feed. eniferBio has developed a new and sustainable production process for a high-quality fish feed ingredient and recently received funding for its solution from two funds, Nordic FoodTech VC and Voima Ventures.</em></p>
<p>Fish is healthier and more ecological source of protein than meat and its consumption is constantly increasing. The decline in fish stocks has led to the increased fish farming which, in turn, is limited to the availability of sustainably produced feed. eniferBio has developed a method for producing Pekilo mycoprotein - a form of single cell protein derived from fungi. Pekilo mycoprotein is nutritious and protein rich cell biomass and can be used as raw material for fish feed. It is produced from biorefineries’ underutilised and renewable organic raw material streams. Pekilo mycoprotein can replace soy, which is commonly used in fish feed. Soy cultivation poses ecological challenges such as the deforestation in South America.</p>
<p>The Pekilo single cell protein production method was originally developed in Finland by the forest industry as early as the 1970s. As the pulp industry developed, the by-products required for manufacturing depleted, but today similar by-products continue to be generated in other industries. eniferBio has modernised this protein production method with new biotechnology and now applies it to the fish feed production. The technology has been tested and optimised in VTT's business incubator, VTT LaunchPad.</p>
<p>“We have demonstrated that the single cell protein manufacturing process works with a variety of industrial by-products which are available globally in huge quantities. There is scope to replace all the soy protein concentrate used in fish feeds today, a market currently of $ 2 billion and growing fast. In addition, we have reformed the process so that the produced protein meets the high quality requirements for fish feed. The production method is sustainable and enables protein self-sufficiency. The results show that with this method we can build a profitable business,” describes <strong>Simo Ellilä</strong>, the founder of eniferBio.</p>
<p>With the support of VTT LaunchPad, eniferBio has built networks with the relevant industry partners and fish feed producers. Both parties are interested in the solution. The next step is the preparation for pilot production.</p>
<p>“We negotiate with side stream producers and optimise our process for the selected side stream. The number of biorefineries is growing globally and they want to utilise the by-products of their production. It is a new source of income for biorefineries. We have already successfully tested side stream samples from all across the world - India, Thailand, Brazil and Canada. Our objective is to start pilot production of single-cell protein in the beginning of 2021 and to produce enough protein on a fast schedule, which can be tested by the fish feed producers. From there the next step is to build a first industrial scale plant in Europe, before starting to export the concept further afield,” says Ellilä.</p>
<p>eniferBio’s technology is on the cutting edge of time as resource-efficient solutions to major global problems are currently being sought. As a result of Covid-19, self-sufficiency and security have become increasingly more important. As we emerge from the crisis, investments will focus even more on sustainable solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Investors include Nordic FoodTech VC and Voima Ventures</strong></p>
<p>eniferBio is financed by Nordic FoodTech VC, which invests in the food technology, and Voima Ventures, which invests in science-based deep tech startups. For the main investor, Nordic FoodTech VC, this is the first investment in Finland while both investors are also investing in VTT's spin-off company for the first time.</p>
<p>“Nordic cutting-edge research provides significant solutions to global food challenges. The continuous change the world is facing is reflected in eniferBio’s solution. In the 1990s, global resources were considered abundant and there was no need for the production of Pekilo protein with its production run down in the early 1990s. Now, however, this historical Finnish invention in its developed form is more relevant than ever. Nordic FoodTech VC's investment strategy is well suited to investing in technology that produces protein from unused by-products into a growing area of ​​food production,” states <strong>Mika Kukkurainen</strong> from Nordic FoodTech VC.</p>
<p>""eniferBio combines the elements of a good startup very nicely. Finnish sustainable development innovation has been scientifically further refined and is now being commercialised by an entrepreneurial research team”, complements Pontus Stråhlman from Voima Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>VTT LaunchPad's first spin-off</strong></p>
<p>VTT LaunchPad has been operating over a year and the business incubator has nine teams that aim to commercialise VTT's research and technology as spin-off companies. eniferBio is the business incubator’s first startup company. This is also an important milestone for VTT LaunchPad.</p>
<p>""eniferBio has proven its technology works. In addition, the eniferBio team has shown its ability to adapt to change and move forward with determination. This is an encouraging example of how a new technology can be converted into a startup,"" states Lotta Partanen, the manager of VTT LaunchPad.</p>

<p>A group of researchers at Tufts University have genetically engineered cow muscle cells to produce plant nutrients not natively found in beef cells. Using the same carotenoid pathway exploited in golden rice, they coaxed bovine cells into producing beta carotene—a provitamin usually found in carrots and tomatoes.</p>

<p>In doing so, they demonstrated that cell-cultured meat might be able to surpass the nutritional profile of conventionally farmed meat.</p>

<p>“Cows don’t have any of the genes for producing beta carotene,” said Andrew Stout, lead author of the study and biomedical engineering PhD student at Tufts University. “We engineered cow muscle cells to produce this and other phytonutrients, which in turn allows us to impart those nutritional benefits directly onto a cultured meat product in a way that is likely infeasible through animal transgenics and conventional meat production.”</p>

<p>These findings, published in the journal <em>Metabolic Engineering</em>, are proof of principle for using genetic engineering and cellular agriculture to create novel foods. Rather than simply mimicking meat currently found in the grocery store, cell-cultured meat products are capable of assuming different shapes, textures, nutritional profiles, and bioactivities.</p>

<p>One such feature is carcinogenicity, or rather, the lack thereof.</p>

<p>“We saw a reduction in lipid oxidation levels when we cooked a small pellet of these cells when they were expressing and producing this beta carotene,” said Stout. “Because that lipid oxidation is one of the key mechanistic proposals for red and processed meats’ link to diseases such as colorectal cancer, I think that there is a pretty compelling argument to be made that this could potentially reduce that risk.”</p>

<p>Nutritionally enhancing cultured meat products might give the burgeoning cellular agriculture industry the leg up it needs to compete with conventional meat. Although cultured meat producers have exponentially lowered the cost of production over the last few years, the technology faces an uphill battle in competing with a heavily subsidized status quo.</p>

<p>“It will likely be challenging for cultured meat to be competitively priced with factory farmed meat right out of the gate,” said David Kaplan, Stern Family Professor of Engineering at the Tufts University School of Engineering and corresponding author of the study. “A value-added product which provides consumers with added health benefits may make them more willing to pay for a cultured meat product.”</p>

<p><strong>Shanghai</strong> — The Lever China Alternative Protein Fund announced today it has completed its first five investments in pioneering early stage alternative protein companies in China:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HERO Protein</strong>:  Lever China Fund participated in the pre-seed round for this Shanghai-based company, whose plant-based chicken, beef and fish products were formulated by former senior R&amp;D executives at Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Gardein and Morningstar </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>HaoFood</strong>:  Lever China Fund led the pre-seed round for this Shanghai-based plant-based chicken company developing tasty and nutritious ground chicken and chicken chunks </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Singularity</strong>: Lever China Fund led the seed round for this Tianjin plant-based seafood company using novel manufacturing technology to produce plant-based shrimp, tuna, eel and other seafood products </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>LIKE Foods</strong>: Lever China Fund led the pre-seed round for this Beijing-based cultivated meat start-up using tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting technologies to create sustainable and healthy animal protein </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avant Meats: </strong>Lever China Fund participated in the Seed round for China’s first cultivated meat company, producing fish meat and whole marine proteins for the food, supplements and beauty sectors </li>
</ul>
<p>“In addition to looking for outstanding entrepreneurs, we prioritize companies that bring innovative and delicious products and novel food technologies to China. Our first five investments support pioneers in China’s alternative protein space, including the first dedicated plant-based seafood company, a plant-based meat company pioneering high moisture extrusion in China, and the country’s first cell-cultivated meat company. Our team’s combined 15-year experience investing in alternative protein provides Lever China Fund with the ability to help our portfolio companies become category leaders in the sector,” said Nina Ju, Investment Director of the Lever China Fund.</p>
<p>The Lever China Alternative Protein Fund was launched in early 2020 by Lever VC, a leading global alternative protein venture capital fund whose partners were early investors in Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, and Lever Foods, a Shanghai-based consultancy that advises on the alternative protein space. The Fund is operated in partnership with the Brinc Accelerator, a Guangzhou, China-based alternative protein incubator and accelerator run by Brinc, a leading global provider of accelerator services. Corporate partners include food and beverage leaders COFCO and Yili Group, national industry trade group the China Plant-Based Foods Alliance, and top global alternative protein ingredient and services companies Givaudan, Cremer and others.</p>
<p>Lever China Fund will invest 40 million RMB over the next four years in entrepreneurs and early stage alternative protein companies focused on the burgeoning mainland China market. Up to 160 million RMB is available in potential follow-on funding from the Lever VC Fund, for a total available investment pool of 200 million RMB.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to see the accelerating growth of alternative protein in China, with industry giants like Starbucks, KFC, Cargill and Nestle adding plant-based meat and dairy products in recent months,” said Lily Chen, Program Manager of Lever Foods. “In addition to the capital the Fund provides, Lever Foods leverages our broad network of contacts in the food and investment sectors to provide our portfolio companies with hands-on support in areas like R&amp;D, fundraising, supply chain, distribution channels and strategic guidance.”</p>
<p>China is the world’s largest consumer market for protein, both by volume and value, and will account for 35% of the global protein market in 2025. China’s plant-based dairy sector has reached 120 billion RMB in annual sales and the plant-based meat sector has been growing 14% per year.  The health and food safety benefits of these products, combined with public interest and strong government support for the space, have created a huge opportunity for innovative alternative protein startups.</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday, October 8 at 9 pm China Standard Time (1 pm GMT/ 9 am EST), Lever China Fund will host an English-language Zoom webinar to brief international investors on opportunities in China’s alternative protein sector, with short presentations from several alternative protein startups.

<ul>
	<li>In 2016, the Chinese government released new dietary guidelines recommending that personal meat consumption be reduced with the aim of an overall reduction of 50% by 2030.[The Guardian June 2016]</li>
	<li>In a 2018 survey conducted by the New Zealand Institute of Plant and Food Research, 2000 respondents, mainly from tier-one Chinese cities, reported that they were eating less pork and poultry. On a net basis, 13.8% reported eating less pork and 6.4% percent were eating less poultry. There was also a rising net 12.5% in plant-based meats and soy product consumption. [China Briefing, August 2019]</li>
</ul>

<p>In response to this and recent health concerns post-COVID, China’s food industry is rapidly introducing plant-based innovations. The Future Food Studio aims to connect and inspire the community to embrace this positive change.</p>

<p>Walmart will add the original 12-ounce pourable JUST Egg – perfect for scrambles, omelets, quiches, stir-fries and a variety of baking applications – to more than 1,900 stores coast-to-coast after it became a strong seller at hundreds of regional locations. About 900 Food Lion stores in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. and 170 Giant stores in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. are also adding the product to their shelves.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Kroger and Kroger-owned stores like Ralphs, Fred Meyer, QFC, Fry's and Mariano's will bring the recently launched folded JUST Egg to their freezer sections. Ideal on toast or inside breakfast sandwiches, folded JUST Egg will also arrive at 1,000 Albertsons and Safeway stores in Arizona, California, Colorado and Washington; Jewel-Osco stores in the Greater Chicago area; Randalls and Tom Thumb in Texas; and 160 Acme stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Original JUST Egg is the fifth best-selling egg out of 88 SKUs at a leading national retailer, and its growth has surpassed numerous mainstream plant-based products in popular categories like meat and milk in conventional grocery. Folded JUST Egg is the #1 frozen breakfast item at a top-five retailer – likely the first time ever that a plant-based protein has achieved #1 in category status in a major grocery store. Folded JUST Egg is also the #1 frozen breakfast item in the natural channel according to SPINS, the leading provider of data and insights for natural, organic and specialty products.</p>
<p>""Bringing JUST Egg to thousands of additional cities and towns across America is a proud moment for our team. Knowing its now available at the grocery store just a few miles from where I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama is particularly exciting for me. Our products are quickly becoming part of the breakfast ritual for families across the country and we look forward to sharing JUST Egg with millions more in the months and years ahead,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just.</p>
<p>JUST Egg retail sales have skyrocketed in the past six months with consumers eating at home more frequently and opting to add healthier and more sustainable plant-based products to their diets. Overall JUST Egg MULO (multi-outlet) unit sales were up 102% February to July. Unit sales are up 102% at a leading grocery chain; up 105% at a leading mass retailer; and up 253% at a leading natural retailer. Case shipments to retail customers in July increased 170% over February and shipments since July are up 330% versus the same time last year.</p>
<p>""We are very grateful to all of our customers for their support of both original JUST Egg and folded JUST Egg. I'm excited to see how quickly we’ve gained distribution and look forward to continuing to build on this success together,"" said Matt Riley, Senior Vice President for Global Partnerships at Eat Just.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eat Just <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200901005343/en/Americans-Plant-Based-Breakfast-New-Study-Finds"">shared the results of a survey</a> of 2,000 Americans conducted by market research firm OnePoll that found more consumers are going plant-based for breakfast versus other meals and more than half look for high protein and low sugar options when making breakfast choices. Six in 10 said they liked the plant-based version of a food product better than its animal-based counterpart and more than half said they believe eggs made from plants are healthier than eggs made by chickens.</p>
<p>The egg set is the fastest growing plant-based category by far – outpacing milk, meat, cheese, yogurt and other products. Dollar sales of plant-based eggs grew 192% in the past year and 228% over the past two years, according to the Good Food Institute, and Eat Just owns about 99% of the category.</p>

<p><strong>BOULDER, COLORADO – </strong> <a href=""https://bondpets.com/"">Bond Pet Foods, Inc.</a>, the Boulder-based company working with biotechnology to make animal-free and protein-rich pet food, today announced the creation of the world’s first animal-free, cultured chicken meat protein for pet food applications. The prototype is a big step on its way to scale-up and commercialize production.</p>
<p>Using a proprietary production process that is more humane and sustainable compared with conventional agriculture, Bond is able to take a harmless, one-time blood sample - in this case, from a heritage hen named Inga who is alive and well at a farm in Lindsborg, Kansas - to determine the genetic code for the best types of chicken proteins to nourish dogs and cats.</p>
<p>The genetic code is then coupled with a strain of food grade yeast. When this yeast is grown in a fermentation tank, it churns out meat proteins that are identical to those typically produced on farm and field. It's a similar fermentation process that’s been used for half a century to make enzymes for cheese, but Bond is reassembling the process to harvest high quality animal proteins.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the cultured chicken protein’s cooking potential as well as its palatability with dogs, Bond enlisted its food science and nutrition teams to develop a baked treat recipe with the novel ingredient, and then fed samples to a select group of lucky dogs at the company’s Boulder headquarters. The exercise showed promise on both fronts, with high mixability and enthusiastic uptake from dog volunteers. More robust feeding trials, including detailed analysis of palatability and digestibility, will be performed in the future.</p>
<p>Bond’s cultured chicken protein, once fully developed, will have the same primary nutrients of conventional chicken meat including its essential amino acids, and will meet or exceed AAFCO requirements for both dogs and cats. Its first chicken-based products will debut in 2023.</p>
<p>“Our initial tests with dog volunteers have been very promising, and its nutritionals, palatability and digestibility will only improve on our path to commercialization,” said Pernilla Audibert, Co-Founder and CTO of Bond Pet Foods. “The science team at Bond is also working on production of other cultured meat proteins made through a similar fermentation process. The successful chicken prototype is a demonstration of our technology’s potential to create a complete portfolio of animal proteins for pet consumption, and beyond.”</p>
<p>“A new wave of responsible food production is emerging, working with the best that nature and science has to offer, and our team is leading this wave in Pet.” said Rich Kelleman, Co-Founder and CEO of Bond Pet Foods. “Our team’s continued developments are laying the foundation to bring high-value meat protein and nutrition to dogs and cats, while removing farm animals from the equation.”</p>
<p>With this milestone, Bond has also closed a bridge round of funding to accelerate its work, with follow-on from seed investors Lever VC and KBW Ventures, and new funds Stage 1 and Trellis Road participating.</p>
<p>Bond’s first consumer product launched last May - its <a href=""https://bondpets.com/get-treats/protein-packed-dog-treat-bar/"">Protein-Packed Dog Treat Bar</a> made with a pure nutritional yeast. While not animal derived, the yeast protein in the recipe is made through a similar fermentation technique and provides high quality supplemental nutrition.</p>

The SQF Certification is a food quality and safety program that is globally recognized in the food industry. The SQF food safety and quality codes are designed to meet industry, consumer, and regulatory requirements for all sectors of the food supply chain.</p>
<p>Improved Nature is honored to receive this certification as it signifies that its products can be sold worldwide and guarantees consumers that every Nature’s PRIME™ product purchased meets the top standards for food quality and safety. Its manufacturing facility is also certified Kosher and Halal.</p>
<p>This milestone is especially significant right now as food safety has been one of the top consumer concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the SQF Institute, while it’s highly unlikely to contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging, now more than ever it is important for the food industry to have Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS) based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles in place to manage food safety risks and prevent food contamination.</p>
<p>“Earning the SQF Certification is a direct result of our team’s hard work to ensure we’re safely producing superior food for consumers, which we know is of utmost importance during a time like this,” said President and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr. Rody Hawkins. “The certification process involves all aspects of food safety and security, beginning with our ingredient suppliers all the way to our customers. We closely monitor our plant proteins through SQF, Kosher, and Halal certifications to ensure that we are delivering the highest quality sustainable protein available on the market today.”</p>
<p>With poultry and beef shortages occurring nationwide due to the pandemic, Nielsen reported that meat alternative sales as a result increased 255% in the last week of March. Due to the increased demand for protein during the pandemic, Improved Nature has made its Nature’s PRIME™ products available <a href=""https://improvednaturedirect.com/"">online</a> for consumers and is offering free shipping in the U.S. for orders over $15.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a representative at Good Food Institute said that plant-based meat alternatives provide not only a great increase in food safety, but also in environmental sustainability. According to the United Nations, truly sustainable foods include the consideration of how the food is produced and its quality. Plant protein is a more efficient and scalable source of food for the growing global population. All Improved Nature proteins are sustainably sourced and provide healthy nutrition with no artificial ingredients.</p>
<p>Improved Nature is committed to providing Better Protein for a Better Planet™.</p>

<p>This project has received €17m funding from the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 838104, and is the largest flagship grant awarded to a UK company by BBI JU. PLENITUDE brings together 10 key players in the bioeconomy spanning 5 EU member states and representing every link in the value chain. This includes expertise in primary processing and industrial operations (Alcogroup SA), biotechnology (3F BIO Limited), product development and applications (International Flavors &amp; Fragrances I.F.F. B.V), primary research and protein expertise (Wageningen University) a specialist consultants covering marketing and sustainability (Bridge2Food, Life Cycle Engineering Srl), and three end-users covering food categories (Mosa Meat, Vivera, ABP) as well as one end-user covering bio-plastics (Lactips).</p>
<p>The project addresses the protein challenge by integrating two established processes into a flagship, large-scale, first-of-its-kind, biorefinery producing bioethanol and sustainable food protein. The process takes a proportion of the sustainable cereal crops that feed the biorefinery to create a feedstock for the fermentation process that produces ABUNDA® mycoprotein. [1] [2]</p>
<p>Olivier Van Rompaey, Senior Vice President AlcoGroup, highlighted: ‘With our core business in sustainable biorefineries, the Plenitude project offers a great opportunity to develop sustainable protein alongside a range of leading partners’.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Dean Holroyd, Group Technical and Sustainability Director, ABP, said: “As a business that produces a variety of products for millions of consumers around the world we are fully committed to ensure that we continuously innovate our product range to include as many tastes and diet choices as possible. Today’s announcement is the latest development on our R&amp;D journey which also extends to improving the sustainability of our beef and lamb products and the introduction and combination of meat free and plant-based products.” “We operate the highest standards in sustainability across our business and we are keen to be actively involved in addressing the challenges of feeding a rapidly growing population and sustainably as possible.”</p>
<p>With initial output capacity of 16k tonnes per annum, this flagship project will increase the availability of sustainable, high-quality food protein. The collaboration between the biorefinery operator, food producers and technology providers will create new cross-sector interconnections, new bio-based value chains, and new bio-based ‘consumer’ products.</p>

<p>CHICAGO, March 24, 2020 — Nature’s Fynd, a food tech company producing a protein from a microbe originally discovered in the geothermal springs of Yellowstone’s ancient volcano, has raised $80 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The company was previously named Sustainable Bioproducts.</p>
<p>Production began this month at Nature’s Fynd’s new 35,000-square-foot manufacturing facility on the site of the historic Union Stockyards in Chicago’s South Side. The company will commercialize food and beverage products across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack occasions.</p>
<p>Nature’s Fynd’s revolutionary fermentation technology grows protein using a fraction of the land and water resources required by traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>The product contains all 9 essential amino acids, making it one of the rare non-animal sources of complete protein. It also includes dietary fiber, calcium, and vitamins. It is very versatile and can be made into alternative meat and dairy products, as well as protein drinks and powders.</p>
<p>“In these challenging times, securing food for our growing population under the immense pressure of climate change becomes even more urgent,” said CEO and co-founder Thomas Jonas. “We must find new solutions that can both nourish people and nurture the planet. Our innovative technology was developed by studying nature’s own solutions for adapting — and ultimately thriving — in environments with limited resources.”</p>
<p>Generation Investment Management LLP, the dedicated sustainable investment firm with $25 billion assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2019, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1 billion fund that invests in companies combating climate change, both led the round.</p>
<p>Other participants include 1955 Capital; Mousse Partners; ADM Ventures, the venture arm of ADM and Danone Manifesto Ventures, the venture arm of global food and beverage company Danone.</p>
<p>“Nature’s Fynd has a highly efficient solution to help address the climate crisis,” said Lila Preston, co-head of the Growth Equity strategy at Generation Investment Management. “We have tracked the team and technology for several years and believe this is one of the most scalable platforms to drive true food system sustainability.”</p>
<p>Added Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures: “As global demand for protein increases, we urgently need new solutions that meet our nutritional needs without further damaging the environment.”</p>
<p>The company, which employs 50 people across its Chicago headquarters and its Bozeman, Montana, R&amp;D center, emerged out of NASA supported research into organisms that thrive in the extreme environmental conditions of Yellowstone National Park’s geothermal springs. Those springs are part of one of the world’s largest active volcanoes.</p>
<p>Nature’s Fynd plans to employ more than 100 people by the end of the year. The company chose Chicago as its headquarters because of its robust food industry, skilled workforce and transportation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Cell-based meat, poultry and seafood is being put forward as a solution that will help fulfil the increased demand for meat as the global population grows to 10 billion people by 2050. It will also provide significant benefits for the environment, animal welfare and public health.</p>
<p>In recent years, cultured meat products have gained momentum, with Mark Post having produced the first cell-based beef hamburger in 2013, Memphis Meats debuted the world’s first cell-based meatball in 2016 and more recently, JUST Inc. unveiled their lab-grown chicken nuggets in October 2019. In between these, various companies have also revealed prototypes including duck, steak, pork sausage, and fish cakes.</p>
<p>Investment in the space has skyrocketed, most recently with Dutch start up Meatable raising €9M in a seed round that will allow them to host a tasting of its first prototype of lab-grown pork by summer 2020.</p>
<p>As well as investment progress and huge technological leaps, there has also been strides made on the regulatory front. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) agreed to a joint regulatory framework, providing cell-based meat with a much clearer path to market in the United States.</p>
<p>A more recent bill, the Food Safety Modernization for Innovative Technologies Act, looks to formalize the agreement between FDA and USDA to jointly regulate cell-based meat products.</p>
<p>This space is growing at an ever increasingly fast rate, yet there are still real issues stunting its success, including scaling up production and making products affordable for mass markets. And with an ever-evolving regulatory landscape, it’s difficult to keep up to date on what is happening in the field.</p>

<p>San Diego, Calif. (January 16, 2020) – BlueNalu, a leading innovative food company developing seafood products directly from fish cells, today announced a strategic partnership with Nutreco, a global leader in animal nutrition and aquafeed. Nutreco’s aquafeed company, Skretting, is a world leader in the manufacture and supply of aquaculture feeds and an important link in the feed-to-food chain. </p>
<p>The two companies have formalized a partnership agreement, that builds upon BlueNalu’s platform technology for production of cell-based seafood products from a wide variety of species.  This is intended to create a more stable and sustainable supply-chain solution as the global demand for seafood is continually increasing. Nutreco brings a breadth of knowledge and deep expertise to the partnership, including fish nutrition, raw materials expertise and ingredient procurement at competitive costs. Both companies’ technologies are well aligned to advance sustainable solutions to feed the world.  </p>
<p>Lou Cooperhouse, President &amp; CEO of BlueNalu, said, “The partnership with Nutreco is another significant milestone for BlueNalu, which will enable our team to accelerate our journey toward commercialization, while also securing a global supply chain partner.  We expect this will provide significant value to our company, as it is our objective to introduce our seafood products in a test market during the next two years, and launch our products in several global markets by the end of this decade.” </p>
<p>The demand for protein, including seafood, will increase as the global population is expected to rise to almost 10 billion by 2050. Innovations and technologies, such as cell-based seafood, may be required to help to meet this demand in a sustainable manner. BlueNalu offers a third option that complements wild-caught and farm-raised seafood that benefits human health, encourages responsible food consumption and promotes food security.</p>
<p>Rob Koremans, Nutreco CEO, says, “Since the global demand for protein is increasing, we need to provide protein from a variety of sources, including traditional aquaculture farming as well as new innovative solutions. Nutreco’s strategic partnership with BlueNalu is very exciting as it opens the opportunity to up-scale real seafood production in a highly sustainable way.”</p>

<p>The new online shop exclusively features the company’s dehydrated Nature’s PRIME plant-based meat alternative product line. The revolutionary Nature’s PRIME products are made with only one ingredient and are available for purchase in 8 oz. bags, as well as bulk orders. Nature’s PRIME is ready-to-make plant-based protein offered in a variety of shapes and sizes, including filets, nuggets, poppers, tenders and more.</p>
<p>Improved Nature’s innovative and proprietary process turns non-GMO soy protein into plant-based food that replicates the texture and experience of eating meat. The company’s Nature’s PRIME products are easy to prepare and have a shelf life of up to two years with no preservatives added. An 8 oz. bag of Nature’s PRIME product equals 2.5 pounds of alternative meat once hydrated.</p>
<p>“More than half of Americans are increasing their consumption of plant-based foods. With our Nature’s PRIME product line now online, consumers can more easily enjoy and incorporate healthy plant-based protein into their regular meal planning because it’s a 1 to 1 replacement for meat,” said President and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr. Rody Hawkins.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the best part about our Nature’s PRIME products is that they can replace proteins like chicken, beef or pork in any recipe just by adding flavoring. During the cooking process, Nature’s PRIME products can be spiced, marinated and added to your favorite recipes to create exactly what you’re craving.”</p>
<p>Because plant-based foods offer health and nutritional benefits, consumers are highly motivated to try them. Plant-based diets have been linked to a number of health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cognitive decline. With Nature’s PRIME, consumers also get the nine essential amino acids human bodies need because soy is a complete protein.</p>
<p>Consumers are interested in trying plant-based foods for a variety of reasons, including the environmental benefits. Research suggests that if Americans shifted their diets away from meat and toward plant-based protein, it would significantly decrease carbon-dioxide emissions. Improved Nature uses sustainably sourced soy to provide high-quality nutrition. Plant protein is a more efficient and scalable source of food for the growing global population as it requires less land and water to produce.</p>

<p>CellulaREvolution has identified a significant opportunity in how to make the culturing of cells more efficient and affordable, which will benefit medical and pharmaceutical industries, and also the fast-increasing interest in cultured meat.</p>
<p>CellulaREvolution is the first company in the region to benefit from the North East Angel R&amp;D programme, an initiative backed by Innovate UK and managed by Northstar, to attract increased angel investment into early stage tech businesses. On top of £140,000 from the North East Innovation Fund, supported by the European Regional Development Fund and managed by Northstar Ventures, the company has also been awarded a total £200,000 in grants from InnovateUK and a further £40,000 investment from a private Angel investor.</p>
<p>The company was founded in December 2018 and officially spun-out from Newcastle University in July 2019. The three company founders are Martina Miotto (CSO), Che Connon (CTO) and Leo Groenewegen (CEO).</p>
<p>Co-founder and CTO, Professor Che Connon said, “Whether it’s for the cultured meat, cell therapy or biologics production the need for new ways to grow large numbers of cells in serum free culture is critical to the continued success of these markets. Our plans to generate a bioreactor capable of continuous cell production will become a milestone in the industrialisation of adherent cell manufacture.”</p>
<p>Alex Buchan, Northstar Ventures Investment Director, said “Northstar has been the main investor in North East University spin-outs since 2005, their potential is huge, with the expertise and innovation the teams bring. We are very impressed with the CellulaREvolution team, they have a clearly identified market opportunity and a ground breaking, scalable solution. We are looking forward to supporting them in their growth and scaling their company globally. We are also pleased that they are the first company to benefit from the new North East Angel R&amp;D programme. Working with Angels has always been core to our offering and this programme enables access to a combination of funds to really accelerate the growth of scalable businesses.”</p>
<p>Leo Groenewegen CEO of CellulaREvolution said, “We’re delighted to have the backing from Northstar. It will allow us to become the market leader in the field of continuous cell production. The growing demand for cultured meat, for example, is a potentially multitrillion USD market and we aim to get our fair share of this. The investment also lets us accelerate our product and company development which in turn leads to an increase in company valuation.”</p>
