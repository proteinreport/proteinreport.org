<h2>Company reaches major milestones in commercializing cell-cultivated animal protein</h2>
<p><strong>HONG KONG -</strong> Avant, the first cultivated meat company in China and the first cultivated fish company in Asia, announces today a strategic partnership with QuaCell, an emerging leader in the biopharmaceutical industry in China.</p>
<p>This partnership will combine Avant’s cell cultivation biotechnology platform with QuaCell’s 7,000 m2 ISO and GMP accredited facilities in China, equipped with bioreactors up to 2,000 liters, supplying to FDA-compliant customers globally.</p>
<p>Subsequent to a 90% cost reduction and reaching unit economics in functional proteins with Avant’s FBS-free cell culture media, this partnership targets an additional 75% cost reduction from the current level.  It is expected to be accomplished by converting ingredients to food grade from pharma grade and by optimizing formula for large-scale bioreactors.</p>
<p>By utilizing Quacell’s industrial facilities, Avant will be able to reduce capital expenditure and accelerate its scale-up by at least 12 months. Avant will own the intellectual property generated from this partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mario Chin</strong><strong>, Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Avant</strong> said, “Optimizing serum-free media formula to a food grade environment contributes vastly to scaling up, which is an important step to industrializing our patent-pending cell cultivation technologies.”</p>
<p><strong>C</strong><strong>arrie Chan, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Avant</strong> noted, “The race for cost reduction amongst cultivated meats companies has entered a new phase. With this partnership, we can leapfrog into a larger scale sooner and can make a better CapEx plan ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>Fai Poon, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, QuaCell </strong>remarked<strong>, "</strong>We are excited about this partnership to work with Avant to accelerate commercialization of cell-cultivated animal protein leveraging on our infrastructure.”</p>
