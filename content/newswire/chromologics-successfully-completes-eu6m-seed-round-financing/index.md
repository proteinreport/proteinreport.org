<p>Chromologics is developing a bio-based portfolio of natural colorants via a fungal biotech platform for the food market, tapping into a € 4.6B market opportunity.</p>
<p>The company received an additional € 4M from Blue Horizon Ventures, Novo Seeds, Nordic Food Tech, and angel investor Giampaolo Cagnin. The total seed round, which also included Vækstfonden, was € 6M.</p>
<p>Chromologics was founded in 2017 as a spin-out from the Technical University of Denmark. Since closing their initial seed round in July 2020, they have expanded the team, improved their production yields, engaged with customers, and initiated the regulatory approval of their flagship product, a natural red food color. This new investment not only strengthens the company’s initial strategic vision, but also allows Chromologics to explore and expand the portfolio to address other market segments.</p>
<p>The market for food coloring has continuously moved from synthetic to natural solutions over the last decade. Two main challenges for the natural colorants include compliance with vegan certification standards and, crucially, temperature stability to accommodate food manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>Chromologics’ platform sets a new benchmark for food colorant production. It supports the transition from the input-intensive and wasteful use of food resources towards sustainable, laboratory-grown food colorants. Instead of exploiting high-value crops and insects to extract natural colorants, Chromologics’ natural colorants are produced using precision fermentation. Chromologics is thus freeing up arable land for other crucial foods and decreasing the use of pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
<p>Chromologics is actively forming partnerships and collaborations with food manufacturers, especially those working on new plant-based meat products, to test and evaluate the Chromologics’ natural red colorant solution.</p>
<p><strong>Gerit Tolborg / CEO Chromologics</strong><br />
<em>“I am proud to be CEO and co-founder of Chromologics, and proud to be among the few female CEO’s of tech start-ups. Our journey of successfully translating academic science into a commercial product is just beginning. Our ambition is to grow Chromologics into the market leader of fermented natural color solutions, and at the same time be an inspiration for other female scientists to follow suit.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Thomas Grotkjær / Novo Seeds</strong><br />
<em>“The extended seed round, with participation of new European investors with strong domain expertise, is a clear sign of the momentum of Chromologics. I believe that Chromologics has the potential to drive a significant change in how we think about natural colors.“</em></p>
<p><strong>Regina Hecker / Blue Horizon Ventures</strong><br />
<em>“What the Chromologics team is doing is absolutely fascinating. Their technology has the potential to radically transform the global color industry as it opens the door for nature-based, safe, and reliable colors to the food and beverage industry that can be produced with far fewer resources. We are delighted to support them on this journey.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauri Reuter / Nordic Food Tech VC</strong><br />
<em>“Chromologics has set a great example both in leveraging biology to solve a hard technical problem for better food and in turning excellent research into a fast-growing company. An absolute delight for an investor.”</em></p>

<p><strong>The Founders</strong><br />
Gerit Tolborg and Anders Ødum met in 2016 at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), when they were both pursuing academic careers. After an exciting discovery of a novel group of fungal pigments during Gerit’s PhD, they founded Chromologics. Financed by several soft money grants from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Innovation Foundation Denmark, Gerit and Anders matured the technology of Chromologics to attract international venture capital.</p>
