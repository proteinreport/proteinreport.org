<p>Alameda, CA – March 13, 2023 // <a href="https://www.shiru.com/">Shiru</a>, an AI-powered discovery and development company for novel ingredients, has launched its first product: <a href="https://www.shiru.com/oleopro/">OleoPro™</a>. The ingredient will be publicly showcased for the first time at San Francisco’s Future Food-Tech conference as part of a plant-based crispy chik’n karaage developed by <a href="https://nourishventures.com/">Nourish Ventures</a>, the corporate venture capital arm of <a href="https://griffithfoods.com/">Griffith Foods</a>. </p>
<p>OleoPro is a novel, plant protein-based fat ingredient for use in a range of alternative protein food products. Combining plant proteins and unsaturated plant-based oil, OleoPro is a high-performance, sustainable, and nutritious alternative fat ingredient. It enables a 90% reduction in saturated fat while enhancing technical performance in alternative meats when compared to commonly used, environmentally-taxing structured fats. OleoPro is self-standing, holding its shape at room temperature; browns when cooked; and delivers a juicy, fatty mouthfeel in plant-based meat applications. </p>
<p>“At Shiru, we think consumers shouldn’t have to compromise on taste or texture to make sustainable, nutritious food choices, and we know novel ingredients are crucial to unlocking the next generation of plant-based foods,” said Dr. Jasmin Hume, Shiru’s founder and CEO, “Oils commonly used in plant-based meats today like palm and coconut are disastrous for the environment and aren’t great from a health perspective either. OleoPro is a categorical upgrade, bringing all the juiciness and fattiness we expect from conventional meats to plant-based, but with a much improved nutritional profile and without tearing down the rainforest.”</p>
<p>OleoPro is patent-pending, and comes from Shiru’s proprietary technology platform, <a href="https://www.shiru.com/approach/">Flourish™</a>, which leverages AI to generate unique plant protein insights. Flourish uncovered highly functional proteins that, when combined with more sustainable oils through a novel process, create an ingredient that looks and behaves like traditional animal fat.</p>
<p>​​“We’re thrilled to be partnering with Shiru on the launch of their first ingredient, OleoPro. At Nourish Ventures, we understand food formulation, and recognize the historical challenges associated with delivering a true, fat-like experience for alternative proteins. OleoPro is a real game-changer, and we’re excited by its potential to impact the alternative protein industry,” said Simon Burton, managing director of Nourish Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Griffith Foods.</p>
<p>While initial development has focused on plant-based meat applications across multiple formats, Shiru is exploring additional applications, including plant-based dairy and personal care products. Shiru is currently sampling OleoPro to prioritize initial launch partners, with commercial production beginning later this year.
