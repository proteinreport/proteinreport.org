<p><strong>Vancouver, B.C. – December 10, 2020</strong> – <a href="https://eatbeyondglobal.com/">Eat Beyond Global Holdings</a> (<a href="https://thecse.com/en/listings/diversified-industries/eat-beyond-global-holdings-inc">CSE: EATS</a>) (<a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EATBF/overview">OTCPK: EATBF</a>) (<a href="https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/equity/eat-beyond-global-hldgs">FSE: 988</a>) (“Eat Beyond” or the “Company”), an investment issuer focused on the global plant-based and alternative food sector, is announcing that it has joined the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA).</p>
<p>The PBFA is a San Francisco-based trade association that represents over 170 leading plant-based food companies and is focused on building a strong foundation for the plant-based foods industry to succeed and grow. Launched in March 2016, PBFA works to expand market opportunities for this fast-growing sector of the food industry.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to join the Plant Based Foods Association,” said Patrick Morris, CEO of Eat Beyond. “The association acts as a catalyst for the industry, providing up-to-date reports and data and working closely with investors, as well as retailers to expand opportunities for plant-based food companies.”</p>
<p>This May, the PBFA released a report that showed that U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods were outpacing total food sales throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and that animal meat sales are declining. During the 16-week period ending April 19, 2020, plant-based food sales were up 90% when compared to the year prior. Throughout the four weeks following the “panic buying” period, total plant-based foods sales grew at 27%, which was 35% faster than total retail food.</p>
