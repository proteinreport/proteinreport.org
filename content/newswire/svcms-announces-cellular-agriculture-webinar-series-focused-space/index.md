<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong>, 04/16/2021: SVCMS, LLC, a California based company focused on media and networking surrounding cell-cultured meat and future food technology, announces a webinar series, CMS Astro, planned for Thursday, April 29, 2021 to be held online and in a digital format. In previous years, events hosted by the Cultured Meat Symposium included scientists, researchers, key industry experts, investors, and members of the traditional meat, poultry, and seafood industries. Past sponsors of the Cultured Meat Symposium include Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, Texture Technologies Corp, Benchling, ORF Genetics, Black & Veatch, Chemometec, and Aleph Farms.</p>
<p>CMS Astro is a virtual symposium dedicated to the role of cell-cultured meat technology in space. A single day of talks related to cell-based meat technology in applications of outer space research, space travel, and deep space exploration.
