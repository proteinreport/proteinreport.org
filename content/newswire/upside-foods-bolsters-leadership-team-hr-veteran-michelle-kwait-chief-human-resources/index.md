<p>BERKELEY, Calif. February 22, 2023 — <a href="https://upsidefoods.com/">UPSIDE Foods</a>, the leading cultivated meat, poultry and seafood company, has appointed Michelle Kwait as Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). This news comes as the company enters its next phase of growth, and reinforces the emphasis UPSIDE Foods places on scaling its mission-driven culture alongside its business and technology.</p>
<p>Kwait joins UPSIDE Foods on the heels of the company receiving a historic “green light” from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and as the company continues on its path toward commercialization. She will lead all aspects of people operations, including talent acquisition, learning and development, leadership training, reward and recognition, talent management and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) programming. </p>
<p>“Our team has always been at the heart of UPSIDE. Their courage, creativity and grit have moved the field of cultivated meat from science fiction to reality,” said Dr. Uma Valeti, Founder and CEO of UPSIDE Foods. “Michelle will play a key role in fostering our team's growth, success and well-being as we move into the next phase. Her deep expertise in empowering people to bring out their best work and embrace an enterprise growth mindset is a must-have for us as we move towards our northstar of making our favorite food a force for good.”</p>
<p>Kwait will play an instrumental role in maintaining and building a culture of excellence across UPSIDE Foods’ growing teams and locations. She most recently served as CHRO at Tysers, a global private equity-backed insurance broker based in London, where she built the company's HR organization from the ground up, led the integration of several transformational acquisitions and assisted in the sale of the business. Prior to that, Kwait led HR for the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company and worked in both HR leadership and learning and development roles at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Kwait also spent more than eight years in higher education institutions, including Stanford University.</p>
<p>“I was particularly drawn to UPSIDE Foods because of its mission to change the world for the better. It's clear that the company has attracted a passionate and talented group of people, and I’m looking forward to helping grow this incredible team,” added Michelle Kwait. “UPSIDE cares deeply about its employees, and I’m excited to celebrate and enhance the culture as we take the company to the next level.”  </p>
<p>This announcement comes as UPSIDE Foods prepares to bring its first product, UPSIDE Chicken, to market, following USDA inspection and label approval. For UPSIDE Foods’ press kit, please see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rmozuhb343uyxpd/AAAo2857oDhUL5_mJOrxZTQTa?dl=0">here</a>. </p>
