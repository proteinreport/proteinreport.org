<p>Calysta is an innovator in sustainable products to improve worldwide food security. Calysta develops and commercializes FeedKind protein, an alternative feed ingredient for fish, livestock and pet nutritional products. FeedKind protein is an innovative, competitively priced fish feed ingredient produced from naturally occurring microbes found in soils worldwide. Using a natural fermentation process similar to making yeast, these microbes produce a nutritious, high protein feed that is a sustainable alternative to high protein feed ingredients such as fishmeal. FeedKind protein is a natural, traceable and safe non-animal source of protein produced using the worldâ€™s only commercially validated gas fermentation process.</p>
