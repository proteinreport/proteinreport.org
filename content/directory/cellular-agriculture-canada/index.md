description: "Cellular Agriculture Canada is a nationwide interdisciplinary organization with the mission to support and promote the cellular agriculture industry and research in Canada.Our vision is to connect all stakeholders (academics, industry, government, and consumers) that believe in the power of cellular agriculture. We think that a positive transformation of the agricultural system and the way we eat requires a shift in the way we think about novel foods. Reimagining how we eat and produce our food would require all hands on deck and we are here to catalyze the change!"
