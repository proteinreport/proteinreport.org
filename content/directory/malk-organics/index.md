MALK is more than a product—it’s a passion.
Born with a severe dairy allergy, founder August Vega spent most of her lifetime struggling to find foods that wouldn’t make her sick. Years later, when her son was born with the same allergy, that condition motivated her mission: create a better dairy alternative.
Along with August’s brother Justin Brodnax and cousin Joel Canada, Almond MALK soon became the newest member of the family—and an integral part of their lives.
The company seeks out the freshest new flavors, the most wholesome ingredients and new ways to inspire employees in the fair-wage workplace. But one thing that will never change is the passion for excellence and commitment to our customers.
