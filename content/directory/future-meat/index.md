description: "Future Meat Technologies process starts with GMO-free animal cells that grow indefinitely without animal-derived components.
The cells are grown in patented bioreactors that can replace barns, chicken coops and meat processing factories. Products are indistinguishable from animal-based meat.
This distributive technology is sustainable and cost-effective, and due to rapid growth cycles, it allows producers to rapidly adapt to changing market demands."
