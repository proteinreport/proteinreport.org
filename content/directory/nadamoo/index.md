description: "In 2004, the founders of NadaMoo started making small batches of coconut-milk ice cream for dairy-free friends and family in Austin. Pretty soon, word got around how creamy it was and before they knew it, complete strangers were showing up on our doorstep with spoons! That’s how NadaMoo began. It’s a made-up word that means “no dairy.” We think it’s fun to say and even more fun to eat."
