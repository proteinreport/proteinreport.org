<p>SeaSpire is offering a sustainable solution to the rising concerns for ocean health, food waste and contaminated seafood which include blending nutrition packed plant-based ingredients and cutting edge technology to develop whole-muscle seafood alternatives and new consumer experience with no sacrifice on taste, texture and affordability.</p>
<p>The problem that compelled us to develop plant based seafood alternatives is the waste streams generated from broken seafood supply and processing industries. We are developing whole cut seafood alternatives by harnessing to novel 3D printing technologies and AI-based technologies to simulate conventional seafood from plant-based ingredients.</p>
