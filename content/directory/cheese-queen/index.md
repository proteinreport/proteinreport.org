description: "Producer of plant-based nut cheeses. There is a sustainable know-how developed in the factory. The company is using authentic production methods and hand-makes everything, however, the laboratory tests provide all-important security and reassurance in knowing that everything is fully tested, naturally matured, and loaded with millions of Lactobacillus Acidophilus & Lactobacillus Bulgaricus  – delivering flavor explosions and encouraging superior health. The product is aging naturally and it becomes stronger, healthier and tastier with time."
