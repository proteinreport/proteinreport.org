description: "Cheese is so good it’s addictive, and hard to imagine living without. Whether you’re trying to consume fewer animal products, dairy intolerant, health conscious, or just excited about new foods, we’re out to prove that our plant based cheese is just as satisfyingly delicious as its dairy based counterpart. Using a variety of nut and tofu based recipes we’ve created flavours and textures that are perfect additions to your cheese plate, recipes, and even your cheeky midnight snack."
