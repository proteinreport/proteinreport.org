description: "NoBull Burger originated many years ago, when the chef Crissanne Raymond, created what is now the Original NoBull Burger recipe. As a young mother, Crissanne created the recipe, seeking to feed her family a healthier version of a burger. The recipe became a big hit among family and friends over the years. Crissanne quickly became known as “the veggieburger lady.”After some convincing from the family and realizing that there’s nothing else like it out there, Crissanne set up shop in Charlottesville, VA in 2011 with the help of her daughters, Heather & Elizabeth."
