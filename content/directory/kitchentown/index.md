<p>KitchenTown champions innovation in all its forms so we can drive positive change in our food system from the ground up. We play a critical role in the development, commercialization, and launch of impact-driven and transformational food products. We are actively building a global community of food entrepreneurs and innovators to support each other and create a new sustainable food system.</p>
<p>Our scale-up facility in San Mateo, CA gives food startups access to a commercial kitchen, product innovation lab, direct to consumer warehouse, brand partnerships program, and thriving community of makers. We strive to give food entrepreneurs the resources and guidance they need to grow and scale their business.
