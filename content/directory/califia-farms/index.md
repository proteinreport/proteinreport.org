<p>Inspired by Queen Califia, the mythical namesake of the state of California, Los Angeles-based Califia Farms was founded in 2010 and has become one of the fastest-growing natural beverage companies in the U.S. Renowned for offering the best-tasting plant-based beverages on the market artfully packaged in unique curvy bottles, Califia is now a leading refrigerated Plant Milk, Dairy Free Creamer and Ready-to-Drink Coffee brand in the Natural and Specialty channels. Califia's premium plant milk beverages make it easy for people to make delicious 'plant powered' choices that produce 60-80 percent fewer greenhouse gases than consuming cow's milk2. Most recently Califia launched a breakthrough line of Oat Milks, Dairy Free Probiotic Yogurt drinks and Nitro Cold Brew coffees. Califia is on a mission to return food to its original nourishing purpose by applying creativity and innovation to make plant-based food and beverages that are both good for you and good-for-the-world.</p>
