description: "We’re a fun bunch of coconutters who are on a mission to spread the coco-love far and wide by sharing delicious coconut yogurts and desserts with the world, and giving something back to the planet and its people. Free from dairy, refined sugar, soya, and gluten, but not temptation. Bursting with life-giving nutrients and glorious flavours, we reckon it’ll be love at first spoonful! Sold in the UK, USA, France, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Finland and NZ."
