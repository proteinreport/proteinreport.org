description: "Meatless uses seaweed products to bind ingredients, which results in a relatively low (fossil) energy consumption. In addition, these ingredients have significantly different properties compared to extrusion products. Meatless ingredients have a higher WHC (Water Holding Capacity). Because of the high heat stability the end products containing Meatless ingredients will still be very juicy after frying, sterilizing and deep frying."
