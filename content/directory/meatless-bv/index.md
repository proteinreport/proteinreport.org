description: "Meatless uses seaweed products to bind ingredients, which results in a relatively low (fossil) energy consumption. In addition, these ingredients have significantly different properties compared to extrusion products. Meatless ingredients have a higher WHC (Water Holding Capacity). Because of the high heat stability the end products containing Meatless ingredients will still be very juicy after frying, sterilizing and deep frying."

<p>Meatless uses seaweed products to bind ingredients, which results in a relatively low (fossil) energy consumption. In addition, these ingredients have significantly different properties compared to extrusion products. Meatless ingredients have a higher WHC (Water Holding Capacity). Because of the high heat stability the end products containing Meatless ingredients will still be very juicy after frying, sterilizing and deep frying. Meatless is used as a basic ingredient in vegetarian fish products, for instance, but it is also an ingredient that improves the succulence, the texture and the fat experience of meat products. For use in ready meals and snacks like spring rolls and croquettes, the company also produces larger flakes in natural irregular shapes mimicking little pieces of chickenÂ meat.</p>
