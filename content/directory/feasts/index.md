description: The FEASTS (Fostering European Cellular Agriculture for Sustainable
  Transition Solution) programme, which launched in January 2024, will be
  conducted by a consortium of 36 independent institutions from 17 countries.
  Over the next 3 years, participants will delve into the technologies involved
  in the sustainable production of cultivated meat and seafood. They will
  investigate nutritional, health and regulatory aspects, as well as issues of
  food safety related to these complementary proteins. Ethical questions
  connected with cultivated meat and seafood will be addressed. Environmental,
  economic and social life cycle analysis will feed into dynamic systems models
  and expand the understanding of the multi-dimensional impact of cellular
  agriculture on the environment and the food value chain.
