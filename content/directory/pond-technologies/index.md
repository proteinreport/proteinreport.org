description: "Pond Technologies is a Canadian technology company with applications in pollution abatement, nutrition, the food, and cannabis industries. We create value from emissions. Pond’s technology was originally developed as universal algae platform that provides optimal growth conditions for virtually any algae strain. The sensor-laden growth platform can be applied to terrestrial plants, as well as bacteria. Pond can grow algae using pure, food grade carbon dioxide (the same gas that makes the bubbles in beer and soda) to make algae-based nutraceuticals, food colouring, or animal feed."

<p>Pond Technologies is a Canadian technology company with applications in pollution abatement, nutrition, the food, and cannabis industries. We create value from emissions. Pond’s technology was originally developed as universal algae platform that provides optimal growth conditions for virtually any algae strain. The sensor-laden growth platform can be applied to terrestrial plants, as well as bacteria. Pond can grow algae using pure, food grade carbon dioxide (the same gas that makes the bubbles in beer and soda) to make algae-based nutraceuticals, food colouring, or animal feed. Algae can also be used as a substitute for petroleum feedstock for bioplastics, biofoams, cosmetics, or biofuels. Pond has also partnered with St Mary Cement and the National Research Council of Canada to prove that algae can capture and utilize greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities. The company is trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol POND.</p>
