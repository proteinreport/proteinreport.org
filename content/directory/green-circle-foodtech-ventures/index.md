<p>Green Circle Foodtech Ventures partners with companies that will power and/or disrupt the production/distribution of food and beverages. Our team of experienced investment professionals and former food/beverage operators invests in bold entrepreneurs leading the technology revolution in the global food industry. The operational experience of our team and scientific expertise of our advisors makes Green Circle a true value-added investor. In a space that has garnered a great deal of attention recently, capital is being managed by former animal rights activists, former internet tech investors from Silicon Valley and others with limited experience as investors or operators in the food industry. For companies and investors seeking deep domain expertise and an extensive industry network, Green Circle is the solution.</p>
