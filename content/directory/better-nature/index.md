description: "A food-tech start-up dedicated to creating a food system that is better for people and better for the planet. It may be a bold ambition, but we think we’ve found the perfect way to do it - through the magic of tempeh! Traditionally, tempeh involves taking soy beans and transforming them into something better - to ‘better nature’, you might say!By applying a 21st-century lens to this process of tempeh fermentation, a 300-year-old food process that originated in Indonesia, we plan to bring the most nutritious and delicious tempeh-based food products to the world."
