<p>Sophie's Kitchen is the California-based company creating plant-based seafood alternatives including canned tuna, crab cakes, smoked salmon, and new entrées such as lobster macaroni and cheese and seafood jambalaya. Sophie’s soy-free and non-GMO products use pea protein and Konjac root—a high-fiber Asian superfood integral to balancing out protein—and, through a specialized technology that employs high pressure and temperature to transform protein flours into convincingly textured products, provide a viable option to consumers concerned with the heavy metals, antibiotics, and environmental destruction associated with overfishing.</p>
