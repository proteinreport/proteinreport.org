<p>Clean and various. Brewer’s yeast proteins are multiply applicable - from neutral-tasting foam for cappuccino to fibrous structure and spicy umami taste for meat substitutes. And all of that without using artificial additives. </p>
<p>Healthy and sustainable. Proteins from microorganisms are resource-saving and need less water, energy and farmland than other protein sources in the manufacture. They have a great nutrient profile, which makes their quality comparable to egg protein. </p>
