EIT Food is the world’s largest and most dynamic food innovation community, accelerating innovation to build a future-fit food system that produces healthy and sustainable food for all.

Supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union, EIT Food invests in projects, organisations and individuals that share goals and vision for a healthy and sustainable food system. It unlocks innovation potential in businesses and universities and creates and scales agrifood startups to bring new technologies and products to market. EIT Food equips entrepreneurs and professionals with the skills needed to transform the food system and puts consumers at the heart of its work, helping build trust by reconnecting them to the origins of their food.

EIT Food is one of nine innovation communities established by the European Institute for Innovation & Technology (EIT), an independent EU body set up in 2008 to drive innovation and entrepreneurship across Europe.
