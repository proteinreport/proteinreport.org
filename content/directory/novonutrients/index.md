description: "NovoNutrients has a platform technology that turns carbon dioxide emissions into products. The focus is now making nutritious, customizable inputs for the food system. We have already started licensing technology to make large-scale systems that take in CO2 waste and (ideally, green) energy. The systems will make inputs for protein companies which themselves may make: multi-ingredient feeds for animals, plant-based “meats” for people, or meat from cultured animal cells."

<p>NovoNutrients has a platform technology that turns carbon dioxide emissions into products. The focus is now making nutritious, customizable inputs for the food system. We have already started licensing technology to make large-scale systems that take in CO2 waste and (ideally, green) energy. The systems will make inputs for protein companies which themselves may make: multi-ingredient feeds for animals, plant-based “meats” for people, or meat from cultured animal cells. We will support today’s meat and seafood sectors, as well as the ever growing movement of animal-free foodtech companies like Impossible, Beyond, Morningstar Farms, and Memphis Meats. Our main product line is our protein flours. They are all natural, non-GMO, complete proteins, with all the amino acids found in meat, but with considerably lessened impacts on wildlife, land, and water.</p>
