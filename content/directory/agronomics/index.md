<p>We invest in opportunities within the Life Science sector, concentrating on, but not limited to, environmentally friendly alternatives to the traditional production of meat and plant-based nutrition sources such as cellular agriculture, cellular aquaculture and the alternative protein space. We focus on investments that provide scalable and commercially viable opportunities. </p>
<p>We are principally focused on early stage investments. We aim to bring investment opportunities within the Life Sciences sector, often reserved for the private market of venture capital firms, to the public market. Agronomics is uniquely poised to eliminate the barriers to investing in these startups and provide access to these opportunities of potential high returns.</p>
