<p>Sesamilk is the 100% sesame milk that we invented and developed the extracting method of the value of premium grade Thai sesame seeds through the innovation that can bring out the most benefits of sesame seeds in the form of milk. It is a new alternative for consumers who care about health because at the present there is an increasing number of people who are allergic to dairy milk, in which 15-30% is more likely to be allergic to soy milk as well. Apart from the research and development of products from sesame seeds, Sesamilk Foods also promotes farmers in Thailand in planting Thai sesame which is a sustainable economic plant because it is drought-resistant and uses less water in planting as our vision.</p>
