  Nutrition from Water™ (NXW) utilizes microalgae technology to create highly
  nutritious, non GMO, protein-packed nutrition and specialised food
  ingredients. Microalgae require a fraction of the water, land, and time as
  other protein sources and emit a fraction of greenhouse gases. NXW’s products
  have a complete amino acid profile, offering protein and nutritional
  ingredient solutions for sports and active lifestyles. This way, the solution
  enables the sustainable use of ocean and water resources for economic growth
  while maintaining a circular ecosystem.
