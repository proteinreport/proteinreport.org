<p>A novel, environmentally friendly technology for production of natural, fully functional rapeseed protein isolates is offered by NapiFeryn BioTech (NFB in short), a Polish biotechnology company.</p>
<p>NapiFeryn BioTech solutions are dedicated to oilseed processing companies and will be subject to license.</p>
<p>The products of NFB technology, i.e. complete proteins obtained from rapeseed, are an alternative to animal-derived or soy protein isolates. Thanks to their excellent nutritional value as well as functional properties such as solubility, ability to form stable emulsions with oils etc, they can be used as valuable ingredients in novel food formulations.</p>
