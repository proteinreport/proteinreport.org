Fermentalg’s industrial team produces highly concentrated Omega-3 with lower content of saturated fatty acids for the proper functioning of human cardiovascular, cerebral or visual systems. As the original source of Omega-3s, micro-algae replace the intensive fishing of  “fodder” in areas of high level of tension.
The laboratories are developing new food ingredients that can restore natural colors to food while providing real health benefits to specific populations such as infants, athletes and the elderly.
