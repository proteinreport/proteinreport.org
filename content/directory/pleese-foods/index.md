description: "Pleese Foods is a plant based cheese company founded by Kobi & Abev Regev.  Not satisfied with the products available on the market, the couple created a delicious alternative to dairy cheese that would stand the scrutiny of the pickiest eaters of them all… New Yorkers and children. At first, Kobi & Abev wanted to launch with their own pizzeria, “KOBEV’s Plant Based Pizza,” but after doing research they realized that they would have a much more meaningful impact on the planet if they launched their products in grocery stores."

Pleese Foods is a plant based cheese company founded by Kobi <span class="amp">&</span> Abev Regev.  Not satisfied with the products available on the market, the couple created a delicious alternative to dairy cheese that would stand the scrutiny of the pickiest eaters of them all… New Yorkers and children. At first, Kobi <span class="amp">&</span> Abev wanted to launch with their own pizzeria, “KOBEV’s Plant Based Pizza,” but after doing research they realized that they would have a much more meaningful impact on the planet if they launched their products in grocery stores. They named their plant based cheese PLEESE, because their dream is to hear people order pizza, with extra PLEESE!
