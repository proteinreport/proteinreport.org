<p><strong>Strengthening Sustainable & Nutritious Food Systems</strong></p>
<p>As the world adjusts to the impacts of climate change, conflict, and a changing economic landscape, securing access to sustainable and nutritious food is more important than ever.</p>
<p>After returning to in-person events last year with a bang, Future Food-Tech is back in the epicentre of innovation, San Francisco, on March 16-17, 2023. The summit has become a global hub, connecting 1600 international food brands, ingredient providers, investors, start-ups and technology leaders, whilst digging into the crucial issues facing the food industry today.</p>
<p>Over the two-day summit, food-tech pioneers and visionaries will discuss innovative approaches to scaling alt-proteins, new formulations for healthier, nutrient packed foods, and commercial opportunities at the intersection of food and medicine.</p>
<p>This year, alongside an action-packed main agenda, expect to see even more ground-breaking innovator action in our new Start-Up Arena, with a front row seat for cooking demos, food tastings, pitching sessions and interactive workshops.</p>
