This April, the Alternative Fats & Oils Summit will exhibit **exclusive case studies** and **interactive discussion platforms** that will provide you with unique insights into the production of plant-based, microbial, and cultivated fats and oils to eliminate their unsustainable counterparts.

**Recent transformation in the alternative fats and oils landscape** reflects the rising success of innovation in sustainable novel foods that meet consumer demand for healthier and tastier options. With the emergence of algae, yeast, and fungi as non-traditional sources of fats and oils, coupled with significant advancements in food technology, industry experts are eager to contribute to the research and development of sustainable ingredients that will enable their application to meat analogues and alternative dairy or seafood.

The Alternative Fats & Oils Summit will, for the first time, bring together **60+ alternative fat developers** with plant-based and alternative protein food tech innovators, ingredient providers, CPG companies, and investors that will:

* Explore how emulsion, microbial, cultivated, and novel techniques can be adopted for animal-free fats and oils
* Implement latest technologies to mimic unsustainable counterparts in taste and texture
* Establish partnerships to accelerate innovation across the culinary landscape

Case studies will explore how emulsion, microbial, cultivated, and novel techniques can be harnessed to engineer animal-free fats and oils that not only mimic but outperform their unsustainable counterparts in taste, texture, cost, melting point, and nutritional value.

With key decision-makers including Chief Executive Officer’s and Chief Technology Officer’s in attendance, this summit will promise a gathering of influential minds in the industry to generate insights into the latest advancements in alternative fats and oils from the likes of Nourish Ingredients, Optimized Foods, and Mission Barns to comprehend how they are transforming the field.

**Create a roadmap for your alternative fat strategy** by weighing the potential of different alternative fats in various end products, including meat analogues, dairy, and seafood.
