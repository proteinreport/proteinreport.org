<p><strong>How to successfully enter and navigate within the fermentation sector as a food company?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How is fermentation used in the food industry? What does it look like in practice?</li>
<li>How to extract/utilize the microbial biomass/protein resulting from fermentation?</li>
<li>What are major and upcoming microorganisms to consider in novel food production?</li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of these different microorganisms?</li>
<li>Which AgriFood side streams could serve as a substrate for fermentation processes?</li>
<li>How to use the fermentation of side streams to produce microbial proteins?</li>
<li>What other high-value products will be provided by microbial biomass besides protein?</li>
<li>How to scale up fermentation technologies?</li>
<li>What will the microbial biomass/protein production sector look like in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are the questions that we will discuss at our upcoming webinar dedicated to fermentation technologies.Â </strong></p>
