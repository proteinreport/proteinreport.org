<p>Co-hosted by Evolve.ag and Big Idea Ventures, this event will offer insights from four experts on how to propel cell ag into the future.</p>
<p>In this free, one-hour long roundtable, you'll hear from Singapore's pioneers in the cellular agriculture sector:</p>
<p>Fengru Lin - TurtleTree Labs</p>
<p>Vin Srinivas - Gaia Foods</p>
<p>Dr. Sandhya Sriram - Shiok Meats</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew Zhao - Big Idea Ventures</p>
<p>We'll examine how Singapore became the first country in the world to commercially approve cellular agriculture, also known as cultured meat or lab-grown protein, for human consumption. We'll also discuss the regulatory environment of cellular agriculture, food safety, and consumer perception.</p>
