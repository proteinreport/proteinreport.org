The International Scientific Conference on Cultured Meat returns in 2024 for its 10th edition! Join our anniversary in historic Maastricht, The Netherlands on November 17, 18 and 19, 2024 to celebrate a landmark decade of scientific development in cultured meat.

For the past 10 years, ISCCM has helped shape the cultured meat scientific landscape by bringing diverse speakers and audiences from once-disparate fields together as cultured meat researchers. It has become a trusted access point for the cutting edge in this growing field, and cultivates an open and friendly environment where ideas nucleate and fruitful collaborations are nurtured.

We hope to see you next year in Maastricht for our 10th anniversary of ISCCM10, where we will build on this legacy with a three-day program full of scientific talks and panel discussions ranging from cells to food, from media to bioprocesses, and from benchtop science to society.
