<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.cellag.ca/">Cellular Agriculture Canada</a> is excited to announce our next event: Cellular Agriculture and the Canadian Regulatory Framework. Join us on March 4th and explore how a regulatory framework could look like for cultured meat in Canada with regulators from the Canadian government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As cellular agriculture companies continue to move forward and closer to market, it is crucial that a regulatory pathway is developed together with regulators. After CAC published <a href="https://www.cellag.ca/regulatory-white-paper">our white paper</a> exploring a regulatory framework for cultured meat in Canada with regular feedback from Canadian regulators, join us for the <em>first</em> event bringing together Canadian regulators to discuss the regulatory framework around how cultured meat may be regulated in the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From individual presentations by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Health Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the event will conclude with a panel discussion featuring regulators addressing the questions set forth in our white paper. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in learning more about how cultured meat can be regulated in Canada and how it can come to market, register now and we look forward to welcoming you to the event.</p>
