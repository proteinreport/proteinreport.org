<p>The Virtual Summit on AgTech is hosted by the Tuck Center for Private Equity and Venture Capital in collaboration with the Tuck Food & Agriculture Club. This online conference focuses on current trends and issues in agriculture and technology.</p>
<p>The Tuck AgTech Summit aims to bring together some of the most important people and organizations pushing this space forward in order to accelerate the spread of knowledge, create new connections, and generate ideas. Now in its third year, the virtual conference will cover a wide range of cutting-edge topics with an impressive lineup of speakers from around the globe. This year, the conference will also host its first ever Pitch Competition.</p>
<p>In contrast to other conferences and convenings, the Tuck AgTech Summit is designed to be accessible from anywhere in the world with a simple, low-cost registration.  Using the innovative <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/">Crowdcast</a> platform, attendees join an interactive online environment.  Registration requires a small donation ($5 minimum).  All conference proceeds will be donated to non-profit partners, to be announced for 2021.</p>
