<p>The 2nd Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Summit Europe returns this summer with unmissable content on the technical implications for the production of novel foods: </p>
<ul>
<li>Strain development and synthetic biology technologies</li>
<li>Scale-up planning and execution case studies</li>
<li>Ideal fermentation design panel discussions: liquid vs solid-state approaches</li>
<li>Downstream purification techniques: yield maximisation and by-product minimisation</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these in-depth example-based sessions, our focus day is set to explore personal <em>commercial and regulatory</em> journeys, from companies such as <strong>Better Dairy</strong>, <strong>Unilever, </strong>and<strong> ENOUGH</strong>. </p>
<p>This event is the ultimate platform for precision and biomass fermentation companies and end-to-end product users to explore the novel foods industry from every angle of product development.</p>
