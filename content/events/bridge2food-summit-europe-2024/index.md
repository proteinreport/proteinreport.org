Bridge2Food is thrilled to announce the co-location of Course Europe and Summit Europe. Join us from Tuesday, 4 June, to Thursday, 6 June, at the Fokker Terminal in The Hague as we come together for our largest-ever European event!

By co-locating the two events, you will benefit from the renowned programme, theory, and practice of Course Europe, alongside access to increased idea exchange, networking and partnership potential at Summit Europe. Plus, hear the very latest developments in R&D, academia, ingredients, product development, innovation, and retail.

Previously separate events, your delegate ticket now grants you access to both Course Europe and Summit Europe - uniting the sector together as Bridge2Food Europe.
