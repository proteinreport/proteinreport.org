<p><strong>How are "meatless" meats made? Come and learn with food innovation experts Deutsches Institut für Lebensmitteltechn</strong></p>
<h2>About this Event</h2>
<p>Value-added processing of agricultural products is a great opportunity for Canadians to create jobs, diversify the economy, and create tasty products that we can be proud of!</p>
<p>In this 1-hour webinar come and learn how "meatless" meats are made with extrusion technology. There will be a tour of DIL's food innovation lab and an explanation of the different opportunities to use this technology as well as time for questions.</p>
<p>This is the first in a series featuring how different value-added products are made including farm and factory tours.</p>
<p><strong>About the speaker:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-lammers-b64415aa/?originalSubdomain=de">Volker Lammers</a>, Head of Research Platform Process Engineering at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppaa-webinar-how-are-meatless-meats-made-extrusion-technology-demo-tickets-106800980608">DIL</a></p>
<p>DIL is a leading global contract research company based in Germany that recently opened an office in Calgary.</p>
<p><strong>About food processing extrusion technology:</strong></p>
<p>Extruders can be found in many of today’s industries, particularly in polymer, pharmaceutical, and food processing. Their use has expanded over the last decades due to versatile applications, high throughput, and low production costs. Typical examples for extruded food products are pasta, breakfast cereals, snacks, and Texturized Vegetable Protein (TVP). The integration of different unit operations plus the continuous operation mode facilitate the development of a wide range of products with tailored attributes. Depending on ingredients and process conditions, the raw material undergoes transformations that can lead to products with very diverse properties.</p>
<p>Besides many other applications, extrusion is highly suitable to convert protein based raw materials under defined thermal and mechanical stresses into fibrous products with meat-like structure. The so-called High Moisture Extrusion (HME) can be considered a key technology for vegetarian and vegan meat analogues.</p>
