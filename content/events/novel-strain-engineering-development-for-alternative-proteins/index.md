Advancements in AI and ML have been paving the way for precision fermentation-derived alternative protein success. With the global microfluidics market expected to reach $23.7 million by 2033, coupled with opportunities where we saw Google partner with Ginkgo, EV Biotech and Shiru investing in alternative proteins of the future, now is an exciting time to spark innovation with novel alternative proteins. This is evident as the fermentation-derived alternative protein market is expected to excel at an annual growth of 14% from now until 2031 â€“ with investments flooding in for strain engineering efforts for protein production, now is an exciting time to spark innovation with novel alternative proteins.
