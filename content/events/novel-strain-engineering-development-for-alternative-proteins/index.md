The Novel Strain Engineering & Development for Alternative Proteins Summit draws on our esteemed Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Series, shifting to a specialized focus on transforming your strain engineering and optimization by leveraging the power of microfluidics, ultra-high throughput, and advanced genetic tools. 

Advancements in AI and ML have been paving the way for precision fermentation-derived alternative protein success. With the global microfluidics market expected to **reach $23.7 million by 2033**, coupled with opportunities where we saw Google partner with Ginkgo, EV Biotech and Shiru investing in alternative proteins of the future, now is an exciting time to spark innovation with novel alternative proteins. This is evident as the fermentation-derived alternative protein market is expected to excel at **an annual growth of 14% from now until 2031** – with investments flooding in for strain engineering efforts for protein production, now is an exciting time to spark innovation with novel alternative proteins.

To align with the surge of marketplace investments for the production of alternative proteins, and the excitement we’re seeing with automation of the future to inform strain development, we have lots in store for you:

* Unlocking metabolic modelling potential to better engineer your pathways for enhanced productivity and yield
* Delving into microfluidics to accelerate engineering and precisely characterize strains of interest for desired end-product outcomes
* Pairing CRISPR with predictive ML to better inform genetic modification decision-making and enhance precision accuracy
* Exploring post-translational modifications to enhance structure and stability upon production to minimize later-stage failures

What’s more, our workshop day will introduce you to all things ML and high throughput, with the likes of Perfect Day, Nourish Ingredients, All G Foods, New Culture, Liven Proteins, UC Davis, University of Texas, and Lawrence Berkeley Labs to name a few.
