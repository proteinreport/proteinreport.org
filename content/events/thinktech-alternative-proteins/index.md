<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />
The ThinkTech! educational programme will enable you to develop skills related to novel food processing technologies focusing on technical aspects, as well as the related soft skills.</p>
<p>Thus, your critical thinking on the development of sustainable food technology solutions will be enhanced, so that you are able to appraise unintended consequences like product performance or sustainability implications.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong><br />
Our mission is to give you detailed theoretical and practical knowledge about several technologies and skills:</p>
<p>Approaches for protein fractionation from plant and microbial sources (EMF = electro-membrane filtration, PLE = Pressurized Liquid Extraction, PCT = Pressure Change Technology)<br />
Extrusion technology for processing of alternative proteins<br />
Inspection of sustainability aspects of the production and advanced technologies</p>
<p><strong>Career Opportunities</strong><br />
Get experiences in the knowledge of new technologies and the processing of alternative proteins. This may help to step into new workplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Duration & Dates</strong><br />
This course will take place on December 8th and 9th of 2021.</p>
