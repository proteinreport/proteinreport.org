**An impact agenda for thought leading food & agriculture executives.** 

In 2024, we will challenge the world’s most influential food and agriculture executives to unlock the barriers to transformational innovation and collaboration at scale.

To achieve this, our innovative program of impact interviews and roundtables will provide thought-leading executives with the platform they need to share critical experiences, rethink collaborative strategies, and uncover a path that accelerates the commercialization of impactful innovation in all food categories.

Going further, by limiting attendance to only the world's most forward-thinking executives will ensure that every connection made and conversation matters.

Join us this fall to forge the transformational tools, tactics, and networks you need and secure a pathway to a more sustainable and resilient food future for us all.
