<p><strong>2022 Theme: Building Agri-Food Capacity, Security & Resilience in Asia</strong></p>
<p>As the anchor event of Singapore International Agri-Food Week (SIAW), the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit will bring together over 900 global leaders to identify the strategic priorities as we build greater capacity, security and resilience in Asia’s agri-food system.</p>
<p>From alternative proteins, aquaculture and CEA to sustainable smallholder production, the world’s leading agribusinesses, growers, CPG and ingredient brands, entrepreneurs, investors, retailers and policymakers will reunite to tackle the critical issues of 2022 and the decade ahead.</p>
<p>Taking place on October 26-28 at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, this renowned leadership summit will deliver three days of high-level discussion, networking and deal-making. Featuring Ministerial keynotes, interactive panels, executive briefings and tours to Singapore’s newest agri-food facilities, the summit supports new partnerships and collaborations through a full program of 1-1 meetings.</p>
<p>We’ll also be serving a menu packed with new proteins and locally grown fresh produce, and look forward to celebrating a week of agri-food innovation at our nightly cocktail hour.</p>
<p>Virtual delegates will stream all the content live via our summit platform and have the same opportunity to network before and after the summit as in-person attendees.</p>
