<p>Join us for a discussion about branding one of Australia's hottest food tech startups with Vow cofounder Tim Noakesmith.</p>
<p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vowfood.com/">Vow</a> is defining a new category of food using cultured meat technology. Almost every mouthful of meat eaten on earth comes from just four animal species our ancestors could domesticate several millennia ago. We don’t replicate these meats, instead Vow is building a library of cells from both domesticated and undomesticated species, we will draw on these to create exotic meats that could never be farmed as well as blends of cells from different species to create tastier, more nutritious meats than animals could ever produce. Vow’s team of scientists, engineers and designers are bringing these to market by collaborating with top chefs to create entirely new types of food from cells, then scaling the best of these into consumer facing brands.</p>

<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p>
<p>Tim is a serial entrepreneur and design professional who was recently recognized in Forbes 30 under 30 list. In 2017 Tim became obsessed with using his centered design background to solve the world's most important problems, eventually realizing that creating the food systems that will scale to meet an ever-growing population is one of the most important challenges we face as a human race, so he co-founded Vow, a food/biotechnology company focussed on feeding billions of people sustainably. Before launching Vow Tim was most recently the Global Human-Centered Design Lead for Cochlear, where he was responsible for untangling the complex needs of Cochlear Implant recipients, ensuring their insights were core to the organization's strategy, all while working within tight regulatory medical-tech frameworks. He has held a number of Senior roles in User Experience Design, Service Design and Product Strategy spanning across a diverse range of industries and technologies, including blockchain payments, national communications infrastructure and some of the world's most recognizable FMCG brands.</p>
