Developing a sustainable, accessible food system is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Finding solutions requires collaboration and changes to every aspect of the food system — from production and processing to distribution and consumption.

The Sustainable Protein Forum brings together a passionate community of scientists, technologists, engineers, and nutritionists who believe there is a way to sustainably feed humanity.

Join us for an inspired program that highlights the latest developments in research, policy, and industry impacting sustainable proteins and explore multidisciplinary solutions that revolutionize complex, integrated systems for food production.

Co-located with the 2024 AOCS Annual Meeting & Expo in Montreal, Quebec, the 2024 Sustainable Protein Forum will bring together our largest community yet to collaborate and find solutions to the global food crisis.
