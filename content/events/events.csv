<p>Extrusion technology remains the most extensively used method for plant-based material. Conventional extrusion process has limitations in terms of the size of the “meat” and also the water and fat content. Also the process, utilizes high heat and pressure to texturize vegetable protein, therefore adding on flavours to the product can only be done after the texturizing process which then makes the centre of the product plain tasting.</p>",2022-09-28,2022-09-29,False,Netherlands,Rotterdam,11109,

<p>Our current food production system is associated with a number of global challenges: Foremost, food production is the single most important driver of global greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for substantial water and land use, environmental pollution and reduction in biodiversity. Second, animal farming is associated with zoonotic diseases, evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance and ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. Third, many non-communicable diseases and human deaths are a consequence of malnutrition – including hunger, overconsumption and consumption of highly processed foods. Fourth, many valuable resources within the food production system are discarded as about one third of the produced food ends as food waste or byproducts that are not considered for human consumption.</p>
<p>These challenges are grand; however, tiny microorganisms might be part of their solution. Microorganisms can be used to convert inedible resources into edible food, to enhance taste and texture, to upcycle food waste and to improve the nutritional value of food. In addition, microbial biomass itself can serve as a nutritious source of food. Finally, genetic engineering allows us to improve and expand the natural abilities of microorganisms in this space and can allow us to produce food ingredients in microbial cell factories through precision fermentation.</p>

<p>Humans have been using fermentation to produce bread, cheese or beer for many thousand years. Since then, we have come to scientifically understand the processes of <strong>fermentation and their potential for a more sustainable food system</strong> as well as for our wellbeing.</p>
<p>Today, fat, proteins and dairy are being produced as well as taste enhancers, colors and packaging – all by using microorganisms such as fungi, algae and bacteria, which can be chosen, or engineered, for very specific purposes. In fact, Fermentation is expected to be a key component in the shift toward alternative proteins. Fungi are becoming the new cows. Already, the <strong>investment bonanza has started.</strong> In 2020 alone, fermentation companies raised $587 million USD. What once started with barrels of magically bubbling liquids has turned into the science of precision fermentation.</p>",2022-06-15,2022-06-15,False,Switzerland,Zurich,10740,

<p>Cultivate Tomorrow is the first US hackathon focused solely on cellular agriculture and cell cultured food. This hackathon will work to lower the barrier to enter the cell cultured food industry for STEM and non-STEM individuals. We will create a large network and community of diverse individuals with different backgrounds, skills, and interests. Together we will brainstorm, innovate, and re-imagine the future of food.</p>
<p>This event is open to all undergraduate and graduate students across the US who are interested in becoming more immersed in this field, as well as anyone related to the food and agriculture technology industry or biotech and food tech research. We believe that only through cross-collaboration will this industry succeed in redefining the food system and allocation of our planet's natural resources.</p>
<p>Our teams will be working on one of our three hackathon tracks and submit their final proposals by February 1st. This event will conclude the hackathon with keynote speakers, panel discussions, student presentation booths, networking events, and final awards!</p>
<p>We will have three unique panel discussions and presentations with experts and innovators in these fields:</p>

But this chain is being challenged – by changing consumer demands, by new technologies and, lately, by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the multiple facets of sustainability, from ethical standards to responsible manufacturing, and are demanding more control over the provenance of the products they buy. At the same time, climate change, shrinking farmland and a growing world population are putting pressure on traditional methods of food production and distribution.</p>
<p>When it comes to meeting the challenge of feeding nine billion people while preserving the natural environment, innovation will be key. Already, startups and established companies alike are implementing novel ways to produce, process, distribute and recycle our daily bread. Plant-based meat has made its way onto supermarket shelves. Thanks to significant investment, scientists in laboratories around the world are recreating our nutrition, from dairy to meat. Is cellular agriculture the future of food?</p>
<p>At the conference on <strong>29 June 2021</strong>, the theme of which is <strong>Farms, Labs and Beyond: Fixing a Broken Food System</strong>, we will introduce you to cutting-edge research, revolutionary new business models and smart thinkers, presenting the latest in food innovation.</p>

Join us on March 4th and explore how a regulatory framework could look like for cultured meat in Canada with regulators from the Canadian government.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As cellular agriculture companies continue to move forward and closer to market, it is crucial that a regulatory pathway is developed together with regulators. After CAC published <a href=""https://www.cellag.ca/regulatory-white-paper"">our white paper</a> exploring a regulatory framework for cultured meat in Canada with regular feedback from Canadian regulators, join us for the <em>first</em> event bringing together Canadian regulators to discuss the regulatory framework around how cultured meat may be regulated in the country.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From individual presentations by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Health Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the event will conclude with a panel discussion featuring regulators addressing the questions set forth in our white paper. </p>

<p>Although algae are widely used in biotechnology and agriculture in Europe and worldwide, and the term algae appears in multiple legal documents, the term as such is poorly defined. Algae are very diverse group of organisms, found almost everywhere on the planet. Based on common use the term algae includes representatives from prokariotes (the cyanobacteria) and from several kingdoms of the eukariotes, whereby no scientific agreement currently exists on the exact taxonomic classification of those multiple  eukaryote kingdoms.</p>

AlgaEurope offers a unique opportunity for an exchange between academia and industry, established in a networking-based environment that will explore sector’s evolution worldwide as well as the main European players.

<p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.vowfood.com/"">Vow</a> is defining a new category of food using cultured meat technology. Almost every mouthful of meat eaten on earth comes from just four animal species our ancestors could domesticate several millennia ago. We don’t replicate these meats, instead Vow is building a library of cells from both domesticated and undomesticated species, we will draw on these to create exotic meats that could never be farmed as well as blends of cells from different species to create tastier, more nutritious meats than animals could ever produce. Vow’s team of scientists, engineers and designers are bringing these to market by collaborating with top chefs to create entirely new types of food from cells, then scaling the best of these into consumer facing brands.</p>
<p>Join us as we go into the process of developing a brand identity with Tim Noakesmith.</p>

<p>Tim is a serial entrepreneur and design professional who was recently recognized in Forbes 30 under 30 list. In 2017 Tim became obsessed with using his centered design background to solve the world's most important problems, eventually realizing that creating the food systems that will scale to meet an ever-growing population is one of the most important challenges we face as a human race, so he co-founded Vow, a food/biotechnology company focussed on feeding billions of people sustainably. Before launching Vow Tim was most recently the Global Human-Centered Design Lead for Cochlear, where he was responsible for untangling the complex needs of Cochlear Implant recipients, ensuring their insights were core to the organization's strategy, all while working within tight regulatory medical-tech frameworks. He has held a number of Senior roles in User Experience Design, Service Design and Product Strategy spanning across a diverse range of industries and technologies, including blockchain payments, national communications infrastructure and some of the world's most recognizable FMCG brands.</p>

<p>The alternative proteins industry is in the midst of rapid development. In the first couple months of 2020, a whopping $930 million was invested in alternative proteins, topping record-setting 2019 totals. In the short term, as highlighted by BTI’s federal policy paper, the pandemic and economic downturn have shuttered food service outlets, restricted alternative protein R&amp;D, and induced potential losses in private sector funding and production slow downs. But it could be argued that other areas of our food system have seen greater challenges and outbreaks amid the pandemic. As consumers show more enthusiasm for alternative meats and companies reach milestones like building the first pilot production facilities for cell-based meat, how will the pandemic have impacted the future of alternative meats?</p>
<p>Has the pandemic’s negative impact on the sector hampered the industry’s rapid development? What is the likely trajectory of alternative proteins? Will the public sector play a role? What alternative protein technologies or trends are the most exciting or promising? What gaps remain in answering these questions?</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-lammers-b64415aa/?originalSubdomain=de"">Volker Lammers</a>, Head of Research Platform Process Engineering at <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppaa-webinar-how-are-meatless-meats-made-extrusion-technology-demo-tickets-106800980608"">DIL</a></p>
<p>DIL is a leading global contract research company based in Germany that recently opened an office in Calgary.</p>
<p><strong>About food processing extrusion technology:</strong></p>
<p>Extruders can be found in many of today’s industries, particularly in polymer, pharmaceutical, and food processing. Their use has expanded over the last decades due to versatile applications, high throughput, and low production costs. Typical examples for extruded food products are pasta, breakfast cereals, snacks, and Texturized Vegetable Protein (TVP). The integration of different unit operations plus the continuous operation mode facilitate the development of a wide range of products with tailored attributes. Depending on ingredients and process conditions, the raw material undergoes transformations that can lead to products with very diverse properties.</p>
<p>Besides many other applications, extrusion is highly suitable to convert protein based raw materials under defined thermal and mechanical stresses into fibrous products with meat-like structure. The so-called High Moisture Extrusion (HME) can be considered a key technology for vegetarian and vegan meat analogues.</p>",2020-06-11,2020-06-11,True,,,7000,

But what does it take to bring it to the dinner tables of consumers?","<p>The global demand for meat is expected to rise nearly 70% by 2050. How can we feed this growing hunger for animal protein with less negative impact on the environment, human health and animal welfare? Cultured Meat – grown in a bioreactor instead of a farm – could be the answer. But what does it take to bring it to the dinner tables of consumers?</p>
<p>To find out, join our first ever Innovators’ Club online edition, “From bench to fork: the science behind cultured meat”, with our expert keynote speakers: Liz Specht, Associate Director of Science &amp; Technology at The Good Food Institute, and Lavanya Anandan, Head of Innovation Field Clean Meat, Silicon Valley Innovation Hub of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
<p>During the event, hosted by Annika Zille, Head of Marketing and Market Intelligence at our Innovation Center, we will explore the state of the cultivated meat industry and the biotechnology behind it, answering key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should we eat meat grown in a bioreactor?</li>
<li>Which technology hurdles do scientists have to overcome before cultured meat becomes mainstream?</li>
<li>What role do companies like ours play in the game?</li>
<li>How can partnerships accelerate the way from bench to fork?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/register/rgscjszr"">Register now</a> and discover the science behind cultured meat!</p>
