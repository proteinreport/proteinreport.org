Coordinated by the Consumer Federation of America, the National Food Policy Conference is a unique collaboration between consumer advocates, the food industry, and government, and a key national gathering for anyone interested in agriculture, food, and nutrition policy.

The 47th Annual National Food Policy Conference will feature an exciting line-up of keynote speakers, debate, plenary discussions, and breakout panels. In addition to dietary guidelines and ultraprocessed foods, this yearâ€™s event will explore an array of important food policy issues facing consumers and the food industry, including the intersection of agriculture and nutrition policy, healthcare for diet-related disease, the global food trade, climate change and food safety, and more!
