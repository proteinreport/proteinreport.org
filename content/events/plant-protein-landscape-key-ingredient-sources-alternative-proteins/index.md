<p>Consumer demand for plant-based products is growing rapidly, and a broad portfolio of plant proteins is now available for plant-based meat, egg, and dairy applications.</p>
<p>This webinar will explore the key characteristics of plant protein sources for alternative protein end products, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic overview of plant proteins, processing, and choice parameters like functionality, price, sourcing, and nutrition.</li>
<li>A glance at the landscape of major (e.g. soy, wheat, pea) and emerging (e.g. lupin, mung bean, duckweed) plant protein sources.</li>
<li>Synergistic combinations of different plant proteins.</li>
<li>An overview of processing considerations for plant proteins across key applications.</li>
<li>Consumer perceptions of different plant protein sources.</li>
</ul>
