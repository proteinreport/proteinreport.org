<p><strong>Cultivating Partnerships to Scale Novel Proteins</strong></p>
<p>Future Food-Tech’s dedicated Alternative Proteins Summit on June 21-22 will connect global food leaders to map out the future of protein.</p>
<p>Returning for its second year, Future Food-Tech’s dedicated Alternative Proteins Summit takes place in New York to reunite the protein industry to explore new approaches to scaling novel technologies.</p>
<p>On June 21-22 the summit will not only bring important conversations to the fore in the form of debates, panels and presentations, but also give attendees the opportunity to taste the future of food. From our iconic Taste Lab, allowing audience members to network with likeminded business leaders whilst trying new products, to our onstage cook-off session Step-Up to the Plate, the event’s marriage of interactive sessions, content-led programing and targeted networking is unmatched.</p>
<p>Identified through extensive research with food brands, start-ups and investors, key themes to be discussed at the meeting include:</p>
<ul>
