<hr />
<p>In September 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an initiative to supercharge biomanufacturing in the United States and, excitingly, cell-cultured meat was <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/09/12/background-press-call-on-president-bidens-executive-order-to-launch-a-national-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing-initiative/"">directly mentioned</a>. His <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/09/12/executive-order-on-advancing-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing-innovation-for-a-sustainable-safe-and-secure-american-bioeconomy/"">executive order</a> tasked public bodies, including the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, Defense, and Health and Human Services, among others, with submitting detailed plans on how to advance the bioeconomy in their respective sectors. The new initiative targets fields ranging from biopharmaceuticals and cell-based therapies to agriculture and food—including foods made from cultured animal cells. With many specific policy and funding details remaining yet to be announced, to date, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/14/fact-sheet-the-united-states-announces-new-investments-and-resources-to-advance-president-bidens-national-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing-initiative/"">over $2 billion</a> has already been earmarked under the plan. While this is promising news for many biotechnological sectors, it largely overlooks a key component necessary for the development of cell-cultured meat technologies, namely, the need for public academic funding.</p>

<p>Although advocates in the cellular agriculture space have made <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962892422002331"">persuasive arguments</a> to increase academic support for the field, most of Biden’s funding has thus far been aimed at the private sector. To be clear, this is by no means a negative development; cell-cultured meat products have already been <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230117006210/en/GOOD-Meat-Receives-Approval-to-Commercialize-Serum-Free-Media"">launched internationally</a> and more are slated to begin appearing in <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-spurs-innovation-for-human-food-from-animal-cell-culture-technology-301680569.html"">U.S. markets</a>. A <a href=""https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cc4855en"">recent report</a> from the FAO and WHO shows a number of other countries are following suit and beginning regulatory approval processes for cell-based food technologies. In order for these products to ever become more than mere novelties, significant investments in infrastructure—such as those outlined under Biden’s initiative—are absolutely needed.</p>

<p>But so far, cultured meat R&amp;D has largely remained limited to a competitive, quickest-route-to-market focus of the private sector. In this context, technologies designed to address <a href=""https://www.crbgroup.com/insights/food-beverage/cultured-meat"">problems of scale</a> primarily target the production of relatively simplistic unstructured products, like ground meat, and <a href=""https://time.com/6231339/lab-grown-steak-aleph-farms-taste/"">semi-structured</a> products that only partially recreate the fibrous texture of whole-cut meats, like steaks and filets. This approach to R&amp;D seems unlikely to produce new understandings that will allow for the engineering of more complex, multi-fascial structures that represent a large portion of the demand for slaughtered animal meats and which will be necessary for the technology to have the impact it promises.</p>

<p><strong>Bridging complementary fields</strong></p>

<p>While cellular agriculture and other emerging protein technologies would fit squarely within political frameworks focused on environmental and climate-tech development, so far there has been little traction to financially support academic research in these fields. Aside from two consortiums at <a href=""https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/cultivated-meat-consortium-cmc"">UC Davis</a> and <a href=""https://cellularagriculture.tufts.edu/"">Tufts University</a>, there is currently no large-scale academic infrastructure in the United States dedicated to foundational cell-cultured meat research. To remedy this, I believe emphasizing the overlap between cell-based meat engineering and biomedical tissue engineering—specifically cell therapeutic engineering—is needed in advocacy efforts for cellular agriculture.</p>

<p>Despite having distinct goals, cultured meat and cell therapeutic engineering can be considered as sub-disciplines of the tissue engineering field, rather than separate research spaces. As there are already <a href=""https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/position-statements/biomedical-research-funding#:~:text=Formed%20in%201887%2C%20the%20NIH,medical%20research%20throughout%20the%20country."">wells of political will</a> for funding cell-based therapies and other fields of biomedical engineering, broadening recognition of cell-cultured meat as a subdiscipline of tissue engineering could do wonders for encouraging both public and nonprofit funding agencies, as well as scientific talent, to opt into this space. And the advantages would not be one-sided: this approach will facilitate mutually beneficial development of foundational biology and engineering principles within the often-overlooked intersections of these disciplines.</p>

<p><strong>Intersections are abundant</strong></p>

<p>For example, some of the key questions that must be answered in order to produce cell-cultured meats with complex, multi-fascial structures containing skeletal muscle, fat, bone, and marrow tissues are exactly the same kinds of questions biomedical tissue engineers think about daily: how to successfully <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032528/"">co-culture various cell types</a> with different metabolic and biochemical needs; <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961211009082"">biofabrication</a> strategies for the <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014296121301483X"">assembly of complex tissues</a><u>;</u> and development of <a href=""https://humacyte.com/tech/"">massively parallel bioreactor systems</a> to produce tissues that require dynamic inputs in a scalable way.</p>

<p>These may seem like gargantuan tasks, and in many ways, they are. But they are also paramount to any tissue-engineered product becoming practical to produce for consumers. Having a more thorough understanding of the physiology of these skeletal muscle systems is imperative to creating more complex tissue structures for cultured meat products and will provide small victories that can be readily applied to cell therapeutic strategies along the way.</p>

<p>Another focus common to both cell-based therapeutics and cell-cultured meat research regards the media used to grow cells. Developing low-cost, <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00419-1"">FBS-free</a> media formulations is one of the top priorities and key constraints to producing cell-cultured meats at scale and with competitive pricing. However, this is just as important for <a href=""https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/cell-culture-media/specialty-media/t-cell-immunotherapy-media?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=na_en_search_CCM_Immune-Cell-Media&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiArY2fBhB9EiwAWqHK6mmcPTwsUIIoRWFgAwhnqZ1dC-nQATQU-2WFdvN_73Q7hVeIzdWIVRoCpoMQAvD_BwE"">safely producing therapeutics</a> that reintroduce a patient’s immune cells (like <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/car-t-cell1.html"">CAR-T cell therapies</a> for certain cancers) back into their body without also introducing animal-derived sera that could prompt an immune response. As these therapies become more effective and widely used, having cheap but safe media to grow these cells will equally help make them more affordable and accessible to those who are un- or underinsured.</p>

<p>Other areas of interest common to both cell-based therapy engineers and cellular agriculture researchers include <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/chitin-providing-structure-and-biofunction-cell-cultured-meat"">scaffolding materials</a> and how <a href=""https://humanperformancealliance.org/programs/"">factors such as mechanical load</a> affect tissue growth, development, and differentiation. The development of <a href=""https://iscrm.uw.edu/what-is-cell-reprogramming/"">reprogrammed stem cells</a> has also been an enabling factor of biomedical tissue engineering and is being applied to <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28942128/"">other species</a> to develop <a href=""https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/qyang/research/"">more predictive animal models</a> of disease. However, knowledge gained in this vein can also be applied to cell-cultured meat research, and vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>The path to better biotech</strong></p>

<p>Some critics <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00609-5"">have argued</a> that cellular agriculture technology will not address food security concerns in low-resource settings and may actually contribute to food system inequalities. However, such arguments fail to take a long view of the field’s potential if it receives proper academic funding.</p>

<p>Any potentially transformative new technology carries risks with regard to how it is ultimately controlled, utilized, and distributed—and cultured meat is no exception. As the field develops, it is critical to continue discussions around <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2021.753996/full"">implementation strategies</a> that are inclusive of all communities and stakeholders, especially in dialogues with policy makers and consumers.</p>

<p>But it is also important to remember that cultured meat is still in its technological infancy. Back in the early 2000s, when tissue engineering was only just becoming recognized as a field in its own right, similar arguments could have been made about such technologies being exclusive and exacerbating inequalities in access to certain therapies. But now, for instance, we see engineered blood vessels being used to <a href=""https://fmcna.com/insights/articles/humacyte-sends-human-acellular-vessels-ukraine/"">treat trauma injuries</a> within a war setting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Because of the distinct foci, incentives, and risk tolerances of academic vs. industrial research, each sector is poised to fill complementary roles in the pipeline from discovery to the deployment of any biotech innovation. This article suggests that large-scale public and nonprofit funding must be invested in foundational academic research on the tissue engineering of meat—specifically in subjects that are not currently targeted under private-sector R&amp;D funding models.</p>

<p>The open and public nature of such findings will also allow for innovations to be shared and applied more broadly than those that are kept secret or monopolized behind intellectual property protections. Such collaborative information sharing is especially vital in a fledgling field with so many daunting and unanswered questions essential to laying a strong foundation for its long-term feasibility.</p>

<p>The question, therefore, goes back to the beginning of this essay: how to incentivize and build political will to fund such research?</p>

<p><strong>Lighting the way forward</strong></p>

<p>For decades, tissue engineering has belonged exclusively to the field of biomedical science. Now, new applications are showing these technologies may have significant potential to positively impact the food and agricultural sectors as well. But compared to medical science, food is far more prone to cultural, social, and political sensitivities that can constrain evidence-based policy making and the allocation of funds where they may be most effective. Rather than rallying behind a movement that contributes to such issues, advocates and researchers in cellular agriculture may find a neutral framing of their work more effective.</p>

<p>In particular, highlighting the complementary nature of cell-cultured meat research with cell-based therapeutics and foundational tissue engineering could help create stronger political will to fund academic study in this field. While foundational scientific research can demand long-term thinking, it can also result in valuable near-term gains based upon discoveries made along the way. Research conducted for NASA’s space exploration program, for example, has resulted in <a href=""https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/space-exploration-and-us-competitiveness"">thousands of advances</a> in medical science, industrial techniques, and household goods when they were applied to other sectors.</p>

<p>Cell-cultured meat does not just hold the promise to radically improve how we produce food and interface with our environment. By taking the tools and techniques of tissue engineering and adapting them to work on a scale as large as agriculture, it also has the potential to change the world in ways we cannot yet imagine.</p>",11313,,

<hr />
<p>With the coming of every technological revolution lies the promise of a better life for everyone. The Industrial Revolution led to lower prices, more goods, and higher wages. The Scientific Revolution of the 20<sup>th</sup> century dramatically improved the quality of life for countless people through the development of vaccines and cures for various diseases, the discovery of new forms of energy, and advances in industrial chemistry that provided new materials for manufacturing thousands of products. Most recently, the Digital Revolution enabled mass communication worldwide and provided democratized access to a previously unimaginable abundance of information, knowledge, and resources.</p>

<p>We are now at the dawn of an imminent Biological Revolution that promises to be the most important technological revolution to date, with the potential to impact all areas of our lives, from health to food, climate, manufacturing, and much more. But even with all of the hype coming from bioenthusiasts, the enormous amount of research being conducted every year, and the billions of dollars being poured into biotechnologies, there’s still another side of the coin we need to consider.</p>

<p>Yes, technological revolutions usually leave societies better off than they were before, but that’s never without some collateral damage. The Industrial Revolution, for instance, was the catalyst for <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/modernization/Population-change"">massive population growth</a> thanks to the overall improved quality of life that the new technologies brought, but at the same time, it involved <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/story/the-rise-of-the-machines-pros-and-cons-of-the-industrial-revolution"">child labor and inhumane working conditions</a> and initiated a surge in <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=~OWID_WRL"">global greenhouse gas emissions</a> that continues to this day.</p>

<p>In the case of the Biological Revolution, the primary concerns are usually related to biosecurity and the misuse of biotechnologies to deliberately cause harm. There are also worries about the ethical considerations of using technologies like CRISPR for human genetic enhancement and the possible ecological consequences of the use of GMOs. But there’s something missing.</p>

<p>The general assumption is that technology is intrinsically neutral — it can be used for either good or bad and the outcome depends on the person or group who uses it. However, history has shown us time and time again that this is not entirely true.</p>

<p><strong>Biased from the start</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology. ― Martin Heidegger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biases are to humans what colors are to a rainbow. They are inherent to people and even though we can endeavor to become conscious of them, we can never totally get rid of them. Our biases shape the way that we think and ultimately the decisions that we make. Furthermore, biases are shaped by the context, culture, and values that surround us.</p>

<p>This means that when a technology is conceived or designed it will ultimately be a reflection of these biases. They may be unconscious or unintended by the people who created the technology, but in the end they are there.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example a seemingly harmless piece of technology: a bridge. During the early to mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses"">Robert Moses</a> served as an urban planner for the New York metropolitan area. By overseeing the construction of parks, highways, tunnels, and much more, he was responsible for creating many of the city’s most iconic features. Yet the urban planning and infrastructure design were heavily influenced by Moses’ racist views. This can be seen in <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/07/05/887386869/how-transportation-racism-shaped-america"">bridges that were purposefully designed</a> to be so low that buses wouldn’t be able to pass under them, only cars. Because poor minorities were the ones that most commonly used public transportation, this prevented them from reaching Long Island’s beaches, allowing only those rich enough to afford a car to pass underneath.</p>

<p>Next, let’s take a look at what we could consider somewhat of a more unconscious bias: a “racist” soap dispenser that only works for white people. I seriously doubt that the designers of the automatic soap dispenser purposefully designed it to work this way. Instead, what most probably happened is that the dispenser was designed under the fair assumption that if you send a beam of infrared light from an LED, this will be reflected by the user’s hand and send a signal to the mechanism to dispense the soap. The thing is that the designers didn’t take into account the entire spectrum of people who would end up using the dispenser, including individuals with a darker skin color that absorbs the light instead of reflecting it.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that technology is not neutral by default. It comes with biases and flaws that are a direct result of their creator’s context, values, and even the things they inadvertently omit. Ultimately, when considering the uses and applications of a technology, we should also take into account human biases and the responsibility and context of the designer because technology will always bring burdens along with the blessings whether we want it or not.</p>

<p>Also, the greater the impact of a technology, the greater its negative consequences will be.</p>

<p><strong>Who will nature serve?</strong></p>

<p>OK. Now back to biotech.</p>

<p>The biotech world also has its fair share of examples where biases, values, and context have shaped the use and/or design of a technology:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10020290"">overrepresentation of white individuals</a> during clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
	<li>The fact that most (&gt;75%) of the sequenced genomes we use to study human health and diseases originate from <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.1854"">white individuals</a> of <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.051"">European descent</a>, even though this ethnic group accounts for <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0394-y"">only 16% of the global population</a>.</li>
	<li>Monsanto developing pesticide-resistant GMO seeds only to end up extorting the same farmers it was supposed to help and becoming a <a href=""https://fortune.com/2014/06/26/monsanto-gmo-crops/"">monopoly that controls the world’s food supply</a> (80% of U.S. corn and &gt;90% of U.S. soybeans are grown with Monsanto’s seeds).</li>
	<li>Biomanufactured insulin <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/09/12/1122311443/insulin-costs-increased-600-over-the-last-20-years-states-aim-to-curb-the-price"">increasing in price by 600% over the last 20 years</a>, despite technological improvements meaning that a vial of human insulin now <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/insulin-prices-could-be-much-lower-and-drug-makers-would-still-make-healthy-profits-2018-9?r=MX&amp;IR=T"">costs only $2.28 to $3.42 to produce</a>.

<p>I believe that this is the real dark side of the Biological Revolution. Yes, biotechnologies will likely have more of a positive impact on society than anything else. But if we fail to recognize the hidden biases and interests behind the use of biotech, its promises will benefit only a handful of people.</p>

<p>What happens if we allow biomanufacturing to develop under the values, culture, and biases of current extractive capitalism?</p>

<p>We could potentially produce as much as <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/the-bio-revolution-innovations-transforming-economies-societies-and-our-lives"">60% of the physical inputs of our global economy</a> using biology, but what if a select few corporations end up capturing this technology with the ultimate goal of increasing their profits and share values?</p>

<p>Biotech promises to increase longevity and cure all manner of diseases, but what if living longer is only accessible to the billionaires of the world and new drugs for diseases are only administered to the most privileged?</p>

<p>The Biological Revolution won’t make miracles by itself — it depends on the people who build it, and it’s our responsibility to guide it through a new system that primarily values people (from all backgrounds and places) and the planet. Otherwise, biotech may become only a tool to perpetuate the status quo.</p>

<p><strong>Integrating all voices into the equation</strong></p>

<p>So how do we build a Biological Revolution that takes everyone into account, minimizes the influence of biases, and ultimately delivers a better future for all? I owe you that one for now.</p>

<p>I don’t think that there’s a definitive answer, but a starting point would be to allow distributed access to biotechnologies (including knowledge, infrastructure, and ultimately the products and services that the bioeconomy delivers). This would prevent them from becoming centralized technologies available only in a few rich countries and amplifying the already large inequalities.</p>

<p>The great thing about biotechnologies is that <a href=""https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/atoms-are-local"">they enable local economies</a>. And as more people from all around the world join the Biological Revolution, the greater diversity of thoughts and contexts we’ll have to minimize the risk of biases tilting the benefits of biotech toward particular segments of the population. Ultimately each community could adapt each technology to better serve their particular requirements, but this will only be possible if they have access to it in the first place.</p>

<p>Another key point would be to integrate responsibility as a fundamental part of the technology design process. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIhxl9MF9-0"">her TED Talk</a>, Cristina Zaga discussed six key principles for designing tech responsibly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assess the values of your technology — including your own values and those of the people you are working for and with.</li>
	<li>Analyze the impact of the technology before you bring it to society.</li>
	<li>Seek out and listen to a diverse range of voices during the design process.</li>
	<li>Assess the power structures impacting the technology, as well as the privileges and economic driving forces behind it.</li>
	<li>Design technology for social justice and equality.</li>
	<li>Design for diversity and inclusiveness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the Biological Revolution is already starting to take these principles into account. A great example would be the <a href=""https://competition.igem.org/"">iGEM Competition</a>, where thousands of students worldwide work on synthetic biology projects that aim to solve local problems in their communities. Teams are required to assess responsibility from the conception of their project, including possible biosafety hazards and the impacts it will have on all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Of course, responsible design and globalized access won’t completely prevent the misuse of biotechnologies — again, all technology comes with both blessings and burdens. However, they set the path that enables a more sustainable and equitable world for all.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the world won’t be the same after the Biological Revolution, and this is only the beginning, so we had better design it to be fair.</p>

<hr />
<p>Cell-cultured meat — meat grown directly from animal cells rather than harvested from slaughtered livestock — although still in its technological infancy, is attracting increasing attention in both popular culture and the scientific community. Driven by sustainability issues associated with conventional meat production, scientists are now beginning to tackle some of the key obstacles to bringing such products out of the lab and into commercial manufacturing facilities. That means overcoming technical and engineering challenges related to cost, product quality, and scalability. After all, no matter how sustainable such foods are, consumers aren’t likely to bite unless they’re also cheap enough, good enough, and widely available. But besides their potential to solve some of the world’s most pressing sustainability problems, slaughter-free meats also offer another key advantage — they can actually be customized to provide improved nutritional and biological functions unavailable in animal-based meats. Fortunately, in the effort to address these challenges and opportunities, there remain some unexploited materials and techniques that may be able to kill two birds with one stone — or as some industry advocates may prefer to say, feed two birds with one seed.</p>

<p>One significant hurdle on the path toward achieving consumer acceptance of cellular agriculture technologies and products is the difficulty in producing whole cuts of meat and seafood, such as steaks and fillets. To form these three-dimensional structures — as opposed to unstructured products like ground meat for burgers — millions of cells must fuse together in a process that requires both physical support and the correct environmental stimuli. The latter include the numerous conditions and factors inside the bioreactors where cell-cultured meats are produced, such as temperature, pH, and the various nutrients that cells need to grow. Physical support, meanwhile, refers to the “scaffold” that cells like to attach to, which aids in their growth and helps create the desired structure and texture for the final products. In the body, or <em>in vivo</em>, this scaffold is provided by ligaments, cartilage, bones, and connective tissues. Outside of the body, or <em>in vitro</em>, as in the case of cell culture, it must be provided by appropriate scaffold materials.</p>

<p><strong>What a scaffold needs to do</strong></p>

<p>In tissue engineering for medical applications, the biochemical and physical properties of native tissues found in the body can be replicated to form mature, functional tissues, such as skin, muscle, and organs, outside of the body. Specifically, in the case of muscle tissue, a diverse assortment of cells can be integrated in a co-culture system (a system containing multiple cell types) on a three-dimensional scaffold to generate muscle fibers, blood vessels, and a dense extracellular matrix — a network of cells surrounded by supporting biomolecules, minerals, enzymes, and other proteins. This environment <a href=""https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/123/24/4195/31378/The-extracellular-matrix-at-a-glance"">enables the cells</a> to form higher structures through the connectivity of the extracellular matrix, which anchors the cells and provides crucial biochemical cues that dictate cellular differentiation and instigate cellular proliferation.</p>

<p>The close relevance of these concepts and techniques to the needs of cell-cultured meat production has made tissue engineering one of the foundational disciplines of cellular agriculture. But despite the similarities, growing meat for human consumption is also a very different animal, so to speak. For instance, lab-grown tissues for medical applications were never developed with mass production in mind. On the contrary, they are often prepared on a small-scale, case-by-case basis according to specific patient or research needs. Their scaffold materials were also never intended to be eaten, provide a meat-like structure, or be used in food applications. Scaffolds for cell-cultured meats, on the other hand, need to meet these basic requirements — they must be inexpensive, edible, and amenable to functionalization.</p>

<p>Given these criteria, collagen and other animal-derived polymers are often considered the gold standard for scaffold materials, where they mimic their natural role during the growth of the animal. However, a dependence on animal-derived ingredients would defeat one of the main purposes of cellular agriculture — replacing animals in the food system with more sustainable technologies. This has led researchers to <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00038/full"">focus on finding</a> animal-free scaffold materials for producing cell-cultured meat.</p>

<p><strong>What about chitin?</strong></p>

<p>One popular and emerging material in tissue engineering research is chitin, a naturally occurring and abundant polymer found in the <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11907"">cell walls of fungi</a> and the exoskeletons of many insects and crustaceans. Chitin ticks several boxes as a potential scaffold material for cell-cultured meat — it’s functional, nontoxic, biodegradable, and inexpensive. Through certain biological or chemical processes, chitin can also be converted into chitosan, a water-soluble derivative with some important physical, biological, and chemical differences. Chitosan, for instance, can be <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00038/full"">fine-tuned and functionalized</a> to attain the desired properties for cellular scaffolds, such as the ability to promote cellular adhesion and proliferation. A wealth of research also already exists describing the use of chitosan in a diverse array of biomedical applications. Because of their high biocompatibility, chitosan-based materials have been employed in drug delivery systems, wound healing, and scaffolds for tissue regeneration.</p>

<p>The successful track record of chitin and chitosan in <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/3/3/27"">science and medicine</a> paves a path toward their application in food technologies. For cellular agriculture, specifically, chitosan scaffolds can be prepared in various forms to promote muscle cell attachment and myogenesis — the process through which particular types of muscle cells attach to one another and the surrounding environment to form larger segments of muscle tissue. This functionality is essential for creating structured meat products that accurately resemble their animal-based counterparts. Chitosan has also been successfully blended with other polymers to further enhance its <a href=""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/821279/"">mechanical properties</a> and better mimic native tissue, while recent research has even <a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01261"">demonstrated</a> the ability of chitosan sponges to support muscle cell growth and differentiation for cultured meat applications.</p>

<p>However, chitosan-based scaffolds are not without their drawbacks. Although growing cells on biomaterials such as chitosan is possible, their performance is often limited by a lack of the recognition motifs (specific sequences of amino acids) needed to support cellular migration — the ability of cells to not only grow but also move around as needed during the various stages of growth to form mature and healthy muscle tissues. As such, additional strategies are needed, such as crosslinking and genetic engineering, to functionalize these scaffolds specifically for the production of cell-cultured meat. Nevertheless, these steps may be a small price to pay considering the advantages such materials offer.</p>

<p><strong>Value as a food</strong></p>

<p>Chitosan has been approved as a food additive by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/24/5961"">is reported</a> to provide numerous health benefits, including the promotion of beneficial bacterial growth in the intestinal microbiome — the collection of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract. Such bacteria are essential for the digestion of food, including the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, and thus have the ability to influence metabolic functions, which plays an important and increasingly recognized role in overall health and nutrition. The human intestinal microbiome comprises over 1,000 different species of bacteria that can be either helpful or harmful to human health depending on their overall numbers and relative proportions.</p>

<p>Although much remains unclear about which specific combinations of microbes define a “healthy” microbiome, it’s widely accepted that dietary factors can alter this sensitive equilibrium, shifting the balance of key microbe populations and potentially inducing or improving certain disease states. Specifically, it is now known that the improper colonization of certain harmful microbes can lead to the overproduction of proinflammatory proteins called cytokines, resulting in chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, which has been <a href=""https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y"">linked to several diseases</a> such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and diabetes. On the other hand, dietary fiber intake <a href=""https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13006"">has been shown</a> to contribute to gastrointestinal health by providing substrates for the growth of beneficial microbes, limiting the activity of harmful ones, and increasing the diversity of fecal microbes, a common indicator of a healthy gut microbiome.</p>

<p>Besides being excellent sources of fiber, chitin and chitosan have also been found to specifically inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms such as <em>Salmonella </em><em>typhimurium</em>, enteropathogenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Vibrio cholerae,</em> while favoring the growth of beneficial species such as <em>Bifidobacterium</em> and <em>Lactobacillus </em>— those often found in traditionally fermented foods. Because<em> </em>chitin promotes the colonization of beneficial bacteria, it <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586600/"">has been linked</a> to improvements in gut barrier function and the reduction of gastrointestinal inflammation.</p>

<p>In addition to their benefits for the intestinal microbiome, chitin and its derivatives have also been associated with improvements in other health disorders. A growing <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/24/5961"">body of evidence</a> suggests that chitin and chitosan can increase antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, reduce cholesterol, and accelerate wound healing. Emerging data further indicate that chitosan and its derivatives may exhibit potent <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/8/7/2117/htm"">neuroprotective effects</a> through the suppression of amyloid-β formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death, with potential applications in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p><strong>A new kind of meat</strong></p>

<p>The promising results obtained for chitin and its derivatives in tissue engineering and other biomedical applications indicate a potentially bright future for these materials in cellular agriculture as well. Their animal-free nature, natural abundance, lack of toxicity, and ability to promote cell growth and differentiation make them ideal candidates for further research efforts in cell-cultured meat. But their numerous benefits as health-promoting ingredients also demonstrate one of the most exciting and underreported potential applications of cellular agriculture technologies — the possibility of creating entirely new kinds of meat with unique nutritional and biological functions. Other research in this vein has even <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1096717620301208?via%3Dihub"">demonstrated</a> that bovine cells can be coaxed into producing β-carotene, a provitamin typically found in plant foods such as carrots and tomatoes. As such, cell-cultured meats grown on chitin- or chitosan-based scaffolds have the potential to simultaneously accomplish two key objectives — solving one of the key challenges hindering the scalability of these products, while improving their nutritional and health-promoting value.</p>

<hr />
<p>It’s a struggle to remain optimistic about the future these days. As if the COVID pandemic wasn’t enough, recent extreme weather events around the world are likely to become more common as the planet gets warmer. Yet despite all the warnings and calls for action, the uphill climb towards a carbon-neutral global economy remains steep. As the world’s population continues to grow, so do per-capita consumption levels across numerous sectors necessary for improving basic standards of living. Given the earth’s limited size and resource constraints, this state of affairs is obviously not sustainable: unless humanity reconfigures its use of natural resources, we will soon reach a breaking point.</p>

<p>Food lies very much at the center of this conundrum. The way we currently produce food exacts huge costs on the environment through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and freshwater depletion. These effects threaten our ability to maintain future food output in the forms of agricultural yields and marine fishery catches. And if we cannot produce higher volumes of food within our current geographical footprint, we will be forced to continue expanding it. But such expansion would further increase environmental harms, even further threatening future food production levels, thus necessitating even more expansion, and so on in a downward spiral.</p>

<p>But there may be hope on the horizon. Consider for a moment that the way we produce food has not fundamentally changed in the millennia since the Neolithic revolution. In contrast, other technological realms such as medicine, transportation, informatics, and communication have transformed dramatically in just the past thousand years. But if a Bronze Age farmer or fisherman were to somehow travel through time to the present, he or she would have no trouble recognizing a farm or a fishing vessel. Granted, thanks to breakthroughs in engineering and breeding methods, we are capable of far greater harvests today than in the past. But our main mechanisms for food production – plants and animals – reflect a comparatively unevolved technological paradigm. As a result, we’re now beginning to approach the limit of edible calories and nutrients we can extract from the biosphere through these methods alone.</p>

<p>Is there some way we can “hack” the global food system to circumvent its current biophysical limits while minimizing harm to the natural environment? The first step towards considering such solutions requires an understanding of food defined by what it consists of, rather than how it’s produced. For instance, all the foods in your kitchen have one key thing in common: they are made up of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in various combinations. This is a useful starting point for what qualifies as food for humans. Food also needs to satisfy two other important criteria: it must be digestible, which leaves out cellulosic materials such as wood and most leaves; and it must be non-toxic, which disqualifies many otherwise nutritious fruits, seeds, tubers, and mushrooms.</p>

<p>So if carbohydrates, fats, and proteins make up the desired end point, how can we get there with as little environmental impact as possible? In this article I focus specifically on protein, as it’s by far the most problematic macronutrient with regard to the environmental challenges mentioned above.</p>

<p><strong>Building blocks</strong></p>

<p>Chemically, protein is made up of five elements: carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen. Among these, it’s the first three that make food production such a complicated affair. The most common forms of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the natural environment are carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and sulfate ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>), respectively. As humans, we lack the biochemical machinery to take up these three compounds from the surrounding environment and convert them directly into protein. Instead, we rely on other forms of life to carry out these processes for us and then simply eat those organisms to acquire the protein within their tissues.</p>

<p>Consider a pea plant, for instance. It first converts CO<sub>2</sub> to sugar through photosynthesis. Some of that sugar is then used to supply the carbon for making protein. Nitrogen gas is not directly accessible for biochemical conversion by any plant, but legumes such as pea plants can form symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria that do have the ability to convert nitrogen gas into other nitrogen compounds, which the plant can then use to make protein. Lastly, sulfur in the form of sulfate ions can be absorbed directly from the surrounding soil and then used for protein production.</p>

<p>From this perspective, when gazing out over a field of crops, what we’re actually looking at is thousands of small, solar-powered chemical converters turning otherwise inaccessible forms of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur into protein and other nutrients. But a significant portion of the crops we grow are not directly consumed by us. Instead, they’re fed to animals in order to produce higher value protein-rich foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs. This extra conversion step separating our plates from the original crops results in significant losses of potential food calories, nutrients, and water – not to mention the added environmental costs of maintaining large populations of animals for human consumption.</p>

<p><strong>What’s on the food-tech menu?</strong></p>

<p>If plants and animals are our current state-of-the-art technologies, what options exist for tweaking, or even reconfiguring, global protein production systems? Given its disproportionate resource requirements and environmental impact, animal protein is low-hanging fruit. If we could somehow decrease the world’s consumption of animal-based foods, agriculture’s environmental footprint would shrink significantly, including a sizable chunk of total GHG emissions. The problem is that production of animal-based foods is still trending upward due to <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666319301047"" target=""_blank"">strong consumer demand</a> and <a href=""https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb6562en"" target=""_blank"">government support</a> around the world. And this trend is likely to continue: In many emerging economies, where populations are growing most rapidly, such foods are often considered a sign of status, and shifting from traditionally plant-centric to more animal-based protein foods remains aspirational.</p>

<p>One approach to offsetting the consumption of animal-based foods such as meat and dairy has been the development of increasingly realistic plant-based analogs. If such products could be adopted at high enough levels, this would indeed be an elegant solution. However, <a href=""http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2021/11/16/slump-in-sales-of-meat-alternatives"" target=""_blank"">recent retail data</a> suggests we’re still far away from such adoption levels, while other <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4fda"" target=""_blank"">research shows</a> these products may not displace livestock as simply as many had hoped. Perhaps more fundamentally, in a scenario where the planet continues to get warmer, plant protein production will become increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events and land degradation, compromising its potential as a long-term solution for global food security.</p>

<p>Now let us consider two alternative sources of animal protein that are currently receiving a lot of attention: insects and cell-cultured meat.</p>

<p>Insects are increasingly promoted as a sustainable source of protein due to their lower environmental footprint compared to conventional livestock. In addition, the cultivation of insects isn’t subject to many of the animal welfare concerns or legislation of vertebrate production animals, such as cattle, poultry, and farmed fish. However, like all animal-based sources of protein, there remains an unavoidable efficiency gap when converting plants to insect protein, making the direct consumption of plant-protein the better option. At the moment, the insect protein sector is therefore focused primarily on using high-grade food waste as a feedstock for rearing insects intended for human consumption. As such, the potential global output of insect protein remains limited by the supply of high-grade food waste, and ongoing efforts to reduce food waste could therefore actually reduce our capacity to produce human-grade insect protein.</p>

<p>What about cell-cultured meat? To begin with, there are no animal welfare issues: Cultured muscle cells are quite happy to be densely packed together inside climate-controlled bioreactors. We can also expect the efficiency of converting feed to animal protein to be much higher, with significantly lower water consumption. In addition, this process focuses exclusively on the part of the animal we wish to eat (muscle tissue) without producing all of the inedible and less desirable body parts, such as feathers, bones, and internal organs.</p>

<p>However, there are some significant drawbacks to this technology, with the first one being cost. Cultivating muscle cells outside an animal’s body is complicated. It requires advanced bioreactors, a very specialized mixture of nutrients and growth factors, as well as highly trained staff to operate and monitor the production process. These constraints put it far beyond the reach of most developing economies where animal husbandry, on the other hand, has been practiced for millennia with decidedly low-tech requirements: farmers merely need to keep their livestock watered, fed, sheltered from the elements, and protected from predators. From this view, livestock may be seen as much cheaper, walking, self-replicating bioreactors.</p>

<p>The second major drawback of cell-cultured meat has to do with the fundamental nutritional requirements of animal cells. Animals acquire the bulk of their nitrogen, as well as nearly all their sulfur, in the form of protein. Plants and fungi, on the other hand, can assimilate sulfate directly, as well as inorganic forms of nitrogen such as ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>). In practice, this means that regardless of whether one is farming whole animals or clumps of muscle cells, they still need to be provided with a protein source, usually of plant origin. From an efficiency perspective, this again raises the question of why we shouldn’t just eat the plant protein. Even if the feed protein conversion ratio — the proportion of protein in the feed that ends up consumable by humans as meat — proves higher in cultured animal cells than in whole animals, it’s still less efficient than simply eating the plant protein directly.</p>

<p>One final drawback of cell-cultured meat is that whole animals have digestive systems while muscle cells do not. Mammalian herbivores, especially ruminants, can digest recalcitrant plant sugars such as cellulose and pectin thanks to the diverse microbial flora inhabiting their digestive tract. Muscle cells lack a comparable enzymatic toolbox and must be provided with much more digestible substrates such as the simple sugar glucose. Thus, even though ruminants contribute to GHG emissions through enteric production of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), their ability to digest cellulose allows for exploitation of land for pasture that might not be suitable for growing crops.</p>

<p>Given the above considerations, we can safely say that plants remain the most sustainable conventional protein source for direct human consumption, but they are vulnerable to changes in climate, depletion of freshwater, and soil degradation. Edible insects and cell-cultured meat offer better protein conversion rates than animals, but they offer no efficiency advantages over direct consumption of plant-based protein. Are there any other options?</p>

<p>One alternative to conventional land-based protein sources is <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-016-0974-5"" target=""_blank"">algal protein</a> – both microscopic algae as well as macroalgae such as kelp. Cultivation of marine macroalgae does not require soil or freshwater, offering a major advantage over land-based protein crops. However, macroalgae cultivated in coastal waters are still vulnerable to natural disturbances such as storms, <a href=""https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba5244"" target=""_blank"">marine heat waves</a>, algivorous pests, and diseases. Marine macroalgae are also prone to <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/5/307/5370317"" target=""_blank"">accumulating toxic metals</a> such as cadmium, and can contain unhealthy levels of iodine. Certain microscopic algae (such as <a href=""https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mr.47.4.551-578.1983"" target=""_blank"">spirulina</a> and <em>Chlorella</em>) have very good nutrient profiles, but open cultivation of microalgae in pond systems is <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960852412016677"" target=""_blank"">vulnerable to contamination</a> by toxic algae and single-celled algivorous predators. These problems can be overcome by using closed cultivation systems, but not without incurring much higher production costs.</p>

<p><strong>The magic of microorganisms</strong></p>

<p>This brings us to our final option: <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-019-00912-3"" target=""_blank"">microbial protein</a>. This category encompasses bulk protein derived from fungal mycelium (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781845697587500137"" target=""_blank"">mycoprotein</a>), yeast, bacteria, and other microorganisms. Just like plants, most microorganisms can utilize inorganic sources of nitrogen and sulfur and therefore don’t need to be supplied with protein as do animal cells. More importantly, microorganisms can acquire carbon from a wide variety of sources: in addition to sugars and fats, many can also assimilate hydrocarbons, alcohols, and organic acids.</p>

<p>Similar to muscle cells, cultivation of microorganisms requires bioreactors to ensure efficient conversion of the nutrient feedstock into protein, while preventing contamination by unwanted microbes. Although this means that capital costs can also be high, the cultivation parameters of microorganisms are considerably less complicated than those of muscle cells. For example, muscle cells require a solid scaffold to support their growth, while microbial cells can be cultivated to high densities simply by being suspended in large volumes of liquid growth medium, provided that they are continuously stirred and aerated.</p>

<p>Bioreactors also confer one significant advantage over other kinds of conventional protein production: their internal environments (temperature, pH, nutrient composition, etc.) can be precisely controlled irrespective of external conditions. This means that microbial protein can be produced pretty much anywhere on the planet regardless of local climate conditions. It’s also worth noting that bioreactors enable three-dimensional cultivation, while plant and algal proteins are confined to two-dimensional production systems due to their dependence on sunlight for photosynthesis. Compared to soy, for example, <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cite.330581203"" target=""_blank"">the largest bioreactors</a> for microbial cultivation can produce in the range of one million times more protein per surface area unit per year.</p>

<p><strong>What about feedstock?</strong></p>

<p>But just like cell-based meat and edible insects, microbial protein production is constrained by the availability of feedstock. That means the geographical footprint and resource efficiency of microbial protein compared to plant-based, cell-based, algal, or insect protein ultimately depends on how the microorganisms acquire their carbon and nitrogen. Protein-rich legumes such as soybeans, peas, and lentils can assimilate both atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen gas directly thanks to photosynthesis (within their leaves) and bacterial nitrogen fixation (within their root nodules), respectively. Like plants, most microorganisms can use ammonia as a nitrogen feedstock, which can be synthesized chemically from nitrogen gas using <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/22672"" target=""_blank"">the Haber-Bosch industrial process</a>. That leaves carbon. At present, microbial protein products commercially available for human consumption such as <a href=""https://www.gamberorossointernational.com/news/the-curious-story-of-marmite-spread-made-with-brewers-yeast-extract/"" target=""_blank"">Marmite</a> (derived from spent brewer’s yeast) and <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/quorn"" target=""_blank"">Quorn</a> mycoprotein rely on sugar as their carbon feedstock. Since this requires arable land for the cultivation of sugar cane or sugar beet, it’s unlikely there are significant reductions in geographical footprint of these compared to plant-based protein products.</p>

<p>One alternative to conventional sugar feedstocks is to instead use <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-5873-8_3"" target=""_blank"">inedible carbohydrates</a> such as cellulose and pectin. These are abundant and can be cheaply sourced from waste products of agriculture and forestry or harvested directly from natural vegetation. But they do require complex treatments with chemicals and enzymes to release simpler sugars the microbial cells can convert into cellular protein, and the high cost of enzymes for cellulose and pectin depolymerization remains a major obstacle to using these types of feedstocks.</p>

<p>However, as previously mentioned, many microorganisms can also use other types of carbon feedstocks such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, organic acids, or even CO<sub>2</sub>. During the 1960s, before the Green Revolution, which dramatically increased yields for key staple crops, many nations were considering using <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/211735b0"" target=""_blank"">fossil fuels</a> as a carbon substrate for production of microbial protein. Today, this would be out of the question since any fossil carbon fed to microorganisms would be respired into atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, no differently than if it had been burned as fuel. However, methane derived from anaerobic digestion of organic material such as food waste or manure, can be used to cultivate specialized methane-consuming bacteria.</p>

<p><strong>Going photosynthesis-free</strong></p>

<p>Many simple organic compounds such as <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-019-0244-4"" target=""_blank"">methane</a>, <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201204995"" target=""_blank"">methanol</a> (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), and <a href=""https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1996/dt/dt9960002187"" target=""_blank"">acetic acid</a> (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) can also be synthesized chemically from CO<sub>2</sub> and used to cultivate microorganisms for protein. This could be revolutionary since it would mean protein can potentially be produced in the complete absence of photosynthesis. Examples of microorganisms that could be cultivated in this way include regular brewer’s yeast and the mycoprotein fungus <em>Fusarium venenatum</em>, both of which are capable of growing on acetic acid instead of sugar as their carbon feedstock.</p>

<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> for feedstock synthesis can be supplied by different means. One way is to heat organic waste matter such as wood or plastic to high enough temperatures that they deteriorate into a mixture of CO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen gas known as syngas. CO<sub>2</sub> could also be captured from industrial emissions (flue gas) or directly from ambient air using a process known as direct air capture (DAC). In both cases, a specialized material binds the CO<sub>2</sub> directly and retains it until the material is compelled to release the bound CO<sub>2</sub>, typically by heating.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href=""https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/enb.2020.0005"" target=""_blank"">some bacteria</a> can convert CO<sub>2</sub> directly into cellular protein using chemosynthesis – a process similar to photosynthesis but powered by the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds (e.g., hydrogen gas) instead of light energy. The concept of using chemosynthetic bacteria as an alternative food source dates back to at least <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260060406"" target=""_blank"">the early 1960s</a> when NASA was looking into food production systems suitable for space travel. Recently, a number of biotech startups such as <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/solar-foods"" target=""_blank"">Solar Foods</a> and <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/air-protein"" target=""_blank"">Air Protein</a> have revived this concept and are busy developing bacterial protein products for both food and animal feed.</p>

<p>Producing microbial protein in the complete absence of photosynthesis could have enormous implications for the geographical footprint of our food systems. <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2015025118"" target=""_blank"">A recent study</a> published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> projected that a solar-powered process for the production of microbial protein, through either chemical conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into organic feedstocks or hydrogen gas-dependent chemosynthetic growth, would use roughly ten percent of the land area required to produce an equivalent amount of soy protein.</p>

<p>However, microbial protein’s potential independence from light energy opens up possibilities for the use of other zero-emission energy sources such as wind, hydro, geothermal, and even nuclear power. As with solar, these energy sources can be used to capture and convert CO<sub>2</sub> into organic feedstocks for microbial cultivation. In the case of chemosynthetic bacteria, the bulk of the energy would be used for electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen gas. Depending on the <a href=""https://energycentral.com/c/ec/future-energy-why-power-density-matters"" target=""_blank"">power density</a> of the energy source, the geographical footprint could shrink to <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00032/full"" target=""_blank"">well below one percent</a> of the land area required to yield an equivalent amount of soy protein.</p>

<p>Another crucial advantage of microbial protein over other sources is its potential for a significantly reduced water footprint. Many microorganisms suitable for protein production are also salt-tolerant to the extent that they could be cultivated in brackish water or even seawater. If seawater can be used for the cultivation process, the issue of water footprint essentially disappears.</p>

<p>Microorganisms even have one more trick up their sleeve: they can be genetically engineered to produce animal proteins such as those found in milk (casein) and eggs (ovalbumin). These recombinant animal proteins could be used to substitute their “natural” counterparts in a wide range of processed foods. Dairy products using recombinant casein from engineered brewer’s yeast are already <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/perfect-day-foods"" target=""_blank"">commercially available</a> in the United States. Meanwhile, researchers in Finland have managed to engineer a wood-degrading fungus to <a href=""https://www.vttresearch.com/en/news-and-ideas/egg-white-protein-production-technology-without-chickens-awarded-earto"" target=""_blank"">secrete egg protein</a> instead of the enzymes it would typically use to digest cellulose and other recalcitrant plant materials. So far, these engineered microorganisms are using a sugar feedstock. But re-engineering them to use organic feedstocks derived directly from captured CO<sub>2</sub> instead is perfectly achievable.</p>

<p>In this article, I have tried to briefly present the current options for global protein production, noting the main benefits and shortcomings of each in terms of capacity, sustainability, and resilience. Animal sources of protein, whether whole-animal or cell-cultured, fare the worst in this comparison due to their inability to synthesize protein from non-protein precursors such as ammonia and sulfate. Terrestrial plants and algae are both fairly reliable protein sources in terms of capacity and sustainability. However, their vulnerability to external factors such extreme weather events, pests, and disease introduces a significant degree of uncertainty for their potential to feed the global population of tomorrow. Ultimately, microbial sources of protein appear to offer the best profile for food security in a climatically uncertain future — provided that an appropriate feedstock is used for cultivation, which excludes fossil hydrocarbons as well as food-grade sugars. The use of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock, either directly for use by chemosynthetic bacteria or chemically converted to simple organics, is clearly the most exciting configuration. However, the complete process from CO<sub>2</sub> capture to protein has yet to be demonstrated at industrial scale.</p>

<hr />
<p>When it comes to trading in meat and dairy for plant-based products, cheese is a sticking point. Even as alternative meats and milks have grown more diverse and sophisticated, the distinctive meltiness and stretchiness of good cheese has remained elusive. But from an environmental perspective cheese is just as problematic as many kinds of meat, boasting the <a href=""https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaq0216"">third largest</a> carbon emissions footprint of any animal food product. And with cheese consumption at an <a href=""https://www.idfa.org/news/american-dairy-consumption-reaches-all-time-high-cheese-butter-and-yogurt-continue-to-drive-growth-for-dairy-industry"">all-time high</a> — even as dairy milk consumption <a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=102446"">has decreased</a> in countries like the US — solving the problem of cheese is only growing more urgent. As Magi Richani puts it: “It feels like the last frontier.”</p>

<p>Richani is the founder and CEO at <a href=""/directory/nobell-foods"">Nobell Foods</a>, one of a handful of startups that have recently been making their mark on that frontier using an emergent technology known as <a href=""/molecular-farming"">molecular farming</a>. Where previous plant-based meats and cheeses have been made from plant materials manipulated to resemble animal products, molecular farming uses plants as a “machine” to produce actual animal proteins.</p>

<p>“Plants, in particular soybeans, are very efficient at making proteins,” says Richani. And they’re flexible: by modifying a plant’s protein-encoding RNA, scientists can direct it to produce any kind of protein desirable. This can include casein, the main dairy protein found in milk that gives cheese its unique properties. Once plants expressing the casein produce seeds, the protein can be harvested, and then combined with plant fats and minerals in a cheesemaking process.</p>

<p>“We are essentially using these plants as mini factories,” explains France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO of <a href=""/directory/tiamat-sciences"">Tiamat Sciences</a>, another molecular farming startup. And the new assembly line isn’t limited to food applications: Tiamat Sciences plans to use its platform to produce custom proteins in as little as three months. “We use the DNA of the protein of interest and incorporate it into a plant pathogen that will ‘hack’ the plant cells to make them produce our protein of interest.” Possible applications could include cell therapy and vaccine development, but for now, Tiamat Sciences is focused on solving a particularly tricky and fundamental problem in cellular agriculture: the production of cells themselves.</p>

<p>“Cellular agriculture is a field that aims to produce animal proteins without the animal, but one of the big impediments is the media that cells are cultured in,” Adil says. Historically, growing cells in a lab has relied on media made using fetal bovine serum, or FBS, a byproduct of the dairy industry that is singularly rich with the proteins necessary for cell growth. “If we can produce these same growth factors using our platform, cellular agriculture can truly be animal free,” Adil says.</p>

<p>There could be a bottom line benefit as well, as molecular farming provides a more streamlined route to animal proteins than farming the animals themselves. Indeed, Richani notes, “cows are not very efficient at turning plants into dairy: it takes ten pounds of plant protein to make one pound of dairy protein and an average of 600 gallons of water to make one gallon of milk.” According to Adil, it is already 10 times cheaper to produce most animal proteins using molecular farming than by conventional animal agriculture methods. By 2025, she estimates, it could be 1000 times cheaper.</p>

<p>With so many potential uses for the technology, it may be only a matter of time before the products of molecular farming are a regular presence in daily life. Already, consumers can purchase skin care products made using molecular farming techniques, such as those from Icelandic company <a href=""/directory/orf-genetics"">ORF Genetics</a>, in department stores. But as molecular farming seeks to fundamentally change the food system, appealing to a majority of likely skeptical consumers remains a challenge. Nobell Foods has often described their target demographic as the 99 percent of the population that is unwilling to compromise on taste and price. “We know from experience that unless food is delicious, affordable, and accessible, it will be hard to drive meaningful adoption,” Richani says.</p>

<p>Adam Tarshis, CEO of <a href=""/directory/mozza-foods"">Mozza Foods</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup working on producing real dairy cheese from plants, considers success to be a replication of mainstream products like Cheez Whiz and Domino’s Pizza. He sympathizes with consumers who have been dissatisfied with current cheese alternatives: himself, despite being primarily driven by animal welfare concerns, initially resisted giving up animal-based cheese. “The fact that I, as someone who was always thinking about the sustainability of food production, wasn’t willing to make that change speaks volumes about how the majority of consumers would be even less inclined.” His goal, he says, is to find the largest audience possible and deliver on a promise: “We can make the same great food but in a better way.”</p>

<p>Making products of molecular farming accessible and affordable will depend on the technology’s scalability. With plants reliably producing casein proteins, companies are shifting focus to the production of other proteins of interest; then, they will focus on incrementally increasing seed production. “This is critical,” Tarshis says. “Once we’ve made the proteins, the question is, how much can we make?”</p>

<p>Still, some of the challenges molecular farming startups currently face are non-technical. “I’m optimistic that people will come to accept the proteins in the molecular farming space are safe,” Tarshis says, especially given their environmental and animal welfare benefits. “People care.” Tarshis anticipates regulators including the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to begin developing industry guidelines over the next year or two.</p>

<p>Funding can also be a major hurdle for emergent biotechnologies. “Development in this industry can take a long time — 10 to 15 years sometimes,” says Dr. Björn Örvar, CSO and co-founder of ORF Genetics. “Companies in this field need to be flexible. In a way, companies have to be thinking in the short term so that they can bring a product to market as fast as possible.” ORF Genetics intends to supply its growth factor — MESOkine — to a number of companies in the cell-based meat industry and work on scaling up for the pharmaceutical industry over the next several years. Mozza Foods hopes to bring their products to market in 2025 under the brand name Lovely Cheese, while Nobell Foods is in the commercialization phase and plans to bring their first products to market by the beginning of 2023.</p>

<p>Most investor support for molecular farming has come from specialty funders so far, but recently, mainstream investors like Kraft, Unilever, and Nestle have shown newfound interest. “I think that just goes to show how much potential this field has and that it’s starting to gain wider recognition. That being said, I think we also have to have a realistic understanding of timelines,” Tarshis says. “Just because we have the science, that doesn’t mean it’s going to be there tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Still, early innovations by these and other molecular farming startups may herald a necessary system-wide change. “I hope that everyone who cares about the environment keeps an open mind about how we are going to feed an extra billion over the next couple of years,” Tarshis says. “This is part of what it will take to have a radical shift in how we produce our food.”</p>",10467,"These aren&#039;t your typical soybean plants.

<hr />
<p>In the spring of 2018, when I was a freshman at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) studying biomedical engineering, I sat in my first lecture of Philosophy and the Environment with Professor Roger Gottlieb. Gottlieb was a white man in his mid-70s with scraggly white hair and a bit of a New York accent. During one lecture, he challenged the class to make an ethical argument for why we should be allowed to eat animals. For one hour, he refuted every argument a student made. As a lover of both animals and food, this shook me, and I spent the next week feeling physically ill each time I ate meat. Over that summer, I tried limiting my meat intake, though I found my weakness to be sushi.</p>

<p>I originally changed my behavior for animal welfare, but I learned during my sophomore year that 18% of greenhouse gas emissions come from animal agriculture [1]. My personal eating habits began to feel like a single shovel out of the mountain of trouble we were in. Gottlieb pushed me to question if I could ever feel fulfilled in a career while climate change and human action destroy our planet and all life on it.</p>

<p>Then, during my junior year, in early 2020, I learned that Dr. Glenn Gaudette, one of my biomedical engineering professors at WPI (currently the Inaugural Chair of Engineering at Boston College), was researching the field of cellular agriculture. I was first shocked, then immediately elated. I felt as though a veil was lifted and I could finally see my path forward. I could learn tissue engineering to solve the issues with our food systems!</p>

<p>Step one was trying to talk to Professor Gaudette, although he was notorious for being difficult to reach. When all electronic communication failed, I found his office hours and staked out the room while he met with his teaching assistants. Suddenly, I heard the click of the Goddard Hall stairwell opening; he was on the move. I jolted up, bolted out, and ran through the hallways to catch him just as he reached the exit. I got my first meeting, and Professor Gaudette even told me to call him by his first name. So, Glenn shared with me his vision of a world with cellular agriculture. Just like the microbrewery scene here in New England, what if we had micro-meateries in every city? Instead of having huge vats filled with yeast to make beer, they would be filled with cells to make meat. Farmers could raise two or three cows that have long-luxurious lives and still manage to feed a whole city!</p>

<p>After a year of working with Glenn, I knew I had to be part of building this new field. Glenn helped me find my way to Dr. David Kaplan’s lab at Tufts, which houses the world’s largest academic group of cellular agriculture researchers. In June of 2021, I walked into Dr. Kaplan’s office on my first day as a PhD student. He had me choose a project to help on while I got my bearings, and I was drawn to the work of a second-year PhD student, Michael Saad, who was working on growing fish cells. I could not believe I had this opportunity; I could finally address my love of sushi! The fact is we are facing a collapse of ocean marine life due to overfishing. For one devastating example, the Atlantic mackerel population is approximately 5% of what it was in the 1980s, while the demand keeps rising [2]. Luckily, Michael and I have been delighted to achieve success by becoming the first researchers to grow Atlantic mackerel cells outside of the body. With this development, we can work towards restocking our oceans, while creating delicious food as a wonderful benefit. I now look forward to a day, not too far away, when I can sit down for a sushi dinner that is saving our planet and the life that should flourish on it.</p>

<p>Coffee was demonized when it was first introduced in Europe in the seventeenth century, gaining the nefarious moniker of “Satan’s Drink” (Pendergrast, 1999). The extreme reaction to this bean percolated to some of the most scrutinous legislature to ever regulate a beverage. This is hard to imagine with a Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, or niche coffee shop peppering nearly every street in major cities. Despite its bitter introduction, coffee has led to the creation of novel industries, countless job opportunities, and dissemination of ideas as people gather to converse over a cup of Joe. As outlined in his book, Innovation and Its Enemies, Dr. Calestous Juma emphasizes that society tends to initially resist innovations. From the use of margarine to the development of highly sophisticated artificial intelligence, society continually repeats this trend of opposition to eventual acceptance followed by enthusiastic embrace (Juma, 2016). This concept is imperative to understand now more than ever as we are currently experiencing a period of hypergrowth in sustainable food technology considering the reality that food production must increase over 70% by 2050 to meet the current rate of population growth. Regardless of how fast technological advances can meet these demands, we need to overcome the bottleneck associated consumer hesitancy for these future food sources to reach their highest potential.</p>

<p>One of the most promising technical advances in sustainable food security is cellular agriculture, producing animal-based products from cultured animal cells independent of traditional factory farming. According to the 2021 Life Cycle Assessment prepared by CE Delft, when compared to chicken farming, which is the most efficiently farmed meat, cellular agriculture has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint and land use by 17% and 63%, respectively (Sinke <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Odegard, 2021). The field of cellular agriculture has grown exponentially since the early 2010s when the world witnessed the consumption of first cultivated hamburger (Fountain, 2013). Since then, many of the challenges associated with this technology have been identified and tremendous strides have been made in the research and development sector of cellular agriculture. For example, the exorbitant cost of growth medium to feed the cells and allow growth at scale has been estimated to be cost-competitive with meat production with relatively few achievable alterations to several of the media components (Specht, 2020). However, to reach the goal of a world fed mainly by sustainable alternative protein sources such as cellular agriculture, it is pivotal to extend equal efforts towards improving consumer perception prior to commercial availability. One major reason for the drastic response to novel technology is influence from incumbent industries, which is difficult to mitigate due to the vast financial resources at their disposal. An independent source of consumer hesitancy comes from an inherent lack of knowledge surrounding the new technology, which can be directly targeted by improvements in formal and informal educational outreach efforts surrounding these innovations. Universities worldwide have untapped potential to address this critical issue by establishing dedicated courses and resources to propel the field of cellular agriculture forward not only in the research and industry spheres but also in consumer exposure and concomitantly their spread of opinions into the general public.</p>

<p>The field of cellular biology is intimately linked with cellular agriculture and as such this technology can and should be incorporated into science curricula as early as possible to improve public perception of this future food source. In the United States, only few select universities, such as those that have extensive resources and are well-connected, offer courses on alternative proteins sources such as cellular agriculture. Furthermore, several of the currently available courses are developed and lead by self-taught, highly motivated students with scarce resources and as such can only scratch the surface of this rapidly evolving field. Universities should focus their efforts on immediately incorporating cellular agriculture curriculum into existing majors with the eventual goal of establishing entirely new majors and even new departments. Achieving this goal is mutually beneficial as universities will also profit by becoming leaders in the field of cellular agriculture and attracting many enthusiastic professors, researchers, and students to their campuses to staff the new departments. As such, any effort universities take toward introducing cellular agriculture courses has the potential to positively impact the academic ecosystem of the university.</p>

<p>The benefits of hands-on research-based courses dedicated to cellular agriculture are multi-faceted, having impacts on students’ academic development, perception, and dissemination of knowledge as potential consumers, as well as the expansion and evolution of research and development sector of this industry. Official universities courses on cellular agriculture benefit students’ immediate academic development as well as their long-term career prospectuses. Courses centered on cellular agriculture are intimately linked to many disciplines like traditional sciences courses such as cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry and physics but also draws heavily on tangential fields such as nutritional and environmental sciences, bioethics, economics, and sociology to name a few. The multi-disciplinary aspect of this technology opens the potential for inter-departmental collaborations within universities, which can extend beyond the context of the classroom into potential research collaborations. Courses should also have complementary hands-on laboratory components, which would exponentially increase the benefit to students as they gain experience directly applicable to industry job positions such as basic skills surrounding cell culture, scaffolding, and bioreactors. Industry partners could guest lecture on these laboratory techniques, inciting interest in cellular agriculture careers as well as creating direct pipelines for networking for students who may become future employees. Finally, cellular agriculture courses should implement non-traditional assignments such as grant writing or business pitches as formal evaluation tools which will not only function towards developing students’ writing and critical thinking skills but also propel the industry forward with novel ideas and a steady flow of funding.</p>

<p>Superficially, students gain direct exposure to how cellular agriculture technology works, which will spark curiosity and openness to trying new products. It is expected that students will informally disseminate information to friends and family, further inciting consumer curiosity. Students are influential actors both within the academic ecosystem and local communities extending beyond the university. As such, the benefits of incorporating cellular agriculture at the undergraduate level will extend beyond the college campus and has strong potential to influence wider reaching consumer perception towards cellular agriculture. The dissemination of information should also be formally incorporated into the curriculum via at least two distinct mechanisms. First, students could create and execute a community course on cellular agriculture in public shared science spaces. Indeed, research supports that peer-teaching positively impacts the opinion of course participants related to controversial socioscientific topics (Chrispeels et al., 2019). A second method for spreading information to a public audience involves the use of social media platforms such as creating blogs posts or podcasts on topics covered in college courses. Students could share these pieces on social media platforms to stimulate thoughtful conversations surrounding cellular agriculture among their peers, friends, and family. Ideally, these public discussions would contribute to counteracting the spread of misinformation online by drawing on inoculation and “pre-bunking” theories, which posit that exposing people to misinformation before it spreads virally through online media acts as protection from future exposure to the false content (Lewandowsky <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Linden, 2021). Overall, cellular agriculture courses combined with student-led outreach efforts will contribute to increased consumer awareness via both direct and indirect pipelines.</p>

<p>The positive effects of incorporating cellular agriculture into undergraduate curriculum will be felt immediately at the industry level as well. Perhaps most importantly, the effort to educate students on cellular agriculture and as a result influence their potential career decisions means that the industry will have better control on increasing the diversity entering the workforce within this industry. This is especially true if courses are introduced in a nonexclusive manner among different types of universities such as R1 universities, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, and historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, industry partners gain unique advertising opportunities among students by agreeing to assist in courses where they can bring their products for live demonstrations. Students and professors can also provide feedback for these companies that can even be collected through formal evaluation tools and used to improve their merchandise. Furthermore, partnering with universities has the potential for financial benefits if industry personnel lead hands on demonstrations or guest lecture within the courses. For example, companies can leverage these efforts as evidence of broader impact within the mission of their businesses, which has become increasingly important while applying for external funding sources. Another financial benefit includes a pipeline for becoming a permeant supplier of laboratory equipment or even cellular agriculture products once they become commercially available for these universities. As such, the creation of courses on cellular agriculture will also positively impact the state of the industry in a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>

<p>To ensure that the general population will enthusiastically embrace cellular agriculture products both before and after they are made publicly available worldwide, we need to focus on increasing exposure to this topic from primary to post-secondary education. The vast influence and untapped potential that universities hold in this sphere cannot be ignored as these universities can collectively benefit students, improve consumer perception, and elevate industry standards in the field of cellular agriculture. As such, establishing robust, centralized resources for cellular agriculture curricula kills two birds with one stone (or the more animal friendly idiom, feeds two birds with one scone) by propelling many different aspects of cellular agriculture forward and directly contributing towards a realistic solution to the impending food shortage. And hopefully, one day in the near future, people will gather and continue to spread ideas for novel innovations over a cup of coffee produced through cellular agriculture (VTT News, 2021).</p>

<p>Cellular agriculture is an innovative solution where the agricultural products are manufactured at the cellular level that is similar to the traditional agricultural products. Cellular agriculture is considered to be the more sustainable and environmentally friendly method due to its ability to emit fewer greenhouse gases and require less water and fewer land resources than traditional agriculture practices (Eibl et al., 2021). But there are still numerous challenges for cellular agriculture like obtaining tissues with similar texture, media optimization, etc., Addressing these challenges and finding promising solutions is the need of the hour.</p>

<p>One of the issues with cellular agriculture comes in the field of cultivating meat. Many academic and industrial researchers are working to improve the meat quality that is produced by cellular agriculture technology. The structure and thickness of the cultured meat are important factors that have garnered the attention of the global cell-based pioneers. As a food technologist with a biotechnology background, my interest also lies in culturing and harvesting cells to develop cultured meat that is at par with conventional meat in terms of sensory attributes. One of the major issues in cell cultivation that hinders providing textured meat tissues is the increased accumulation of lactate that has been proved to be deleterious for the cultured tissues. The accumulation of lactate in the media changes the pH of the cell medium, turning the medium into a hostile environment for the cells. This essay focuses on the potential solution to improve cultured tissue quality by reducing tissue damage — a co-culture system where the tissues are cultivated along with microalgae.</p>

<p><strong>Our issue of focus</strong></p>

<p>One of the most important components of meat is its characteristic texture that provides the taste to the consumers. The texture of the meat tissues influences the “mouthfeel” provided by the meat. The texture of the meat tissue should be thick enough to not crumble while cooking and should be tender enough to provide the mouthfeel and flavor (Arshad et al., 2018). To obtain a similar texture in cultivated meat, three-dimensional (3D) tissue fabrication is being utilized. Currently, in-vitro cultivation of tissue with a thickness of more than 50 μm without the capillary networks seems to be a distant goal that needs to be achieved to impart the livestock meat-like texture (Haraguchi <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Shimizu, 2021). This is due to the lack of vascularization in cultured meat. In conventional meat, the presence of blood vessels facilitates the transfer of nutrients and oxygen to the cells to promote the<br />
growth of healthy tissues. A lack of blood vessels hinders the efficient transfer of nutrients and oxygen to cells that are present in the deep of thick tissues, thereby causing cell death. Modification in the tissue culture system can provide a potential solution to achieve the texture by developing thicker tissues without the vascular system.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Tissue Engineering</strong></p>

<p>Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field where the concepts of engineering and life sciences are utilized for the development of substitute biological tissues that function similarly to the natural tissues (Carletti, Motta, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Migliaresi, 2011). Cell-based meat is meat tissues that are cultivated in a controlled environment that mimics the natural environment of the animal body. In order to mimic the animal body environment, we need four important inputs, namely:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cell Source</li>
	<li>Cell Culture Media</li>
	<li>Bioreactor</li>
	<li>Scaffold</li>
</ul>

<p>The culture media, bioreactor, and the scaffold design are decided based on the type of cell source and the type of cells that has to be cultivated (“Lab Grown Meat — Everything You Need to Know About Cultured Meat”, n.d.). Figure 1 illustrates the process involved in the cultivated meat production.</p>

<p>For the cells to grow in vitro, we need to provide the required nutrients through the growth media. The growth media should essentially contain all the nutrients that the cells get inside an animal’s body. The components of the growth media are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carbohydrates</li>
	<li>Amino acids</li>
	<li>Fats</li>
	<li>Vitamins</li>
	<li>Minerals</li>
	<li>Growth stimuli (signaling molecules)</li>
</ul>

<p>With these molecules present in the right proportion, the growth media nurtures the cells to grow and promotes the cells to differentiate into different types of cells that make up the end product meat (O’Neill, Cosenza, Baar, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Block, 2021).</p>

<p>With the nutrients provided via growth media, the cells proliferate within a bioreactor. To obtain thicker and structured meat-like tissues, the cells need to be transferred into suitable scaffolds. The role of scaffolds is to promote three-dimensional cell growth with continuous perfusion to the growth media. Selection of the suitable scaffold depends on various factors such as mechanical properties, porosity, biocompatibility, etc., (“Cultivated meat scaffolding | Deep dive | GFI”, n.d.).</p>

<p>Following the growth in scaffolds, the cultivated meat gets harvested. At the harvesting stage, the cultivated meat looks no different from the conventional meat. But, cultivated meat takes less time to produce the meat than the conventional one, thanks to cellular agriculture technology. Figure 2 shows the difference between the cellular agriculture method and the animal agriculture method for producing the same end product - meat.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Tissue Damage</strong></p>

<p>Tissue formation metabolism involves a complex chemical reaction that requires adequate energy. The growth media is packed full of nutrients for energy provision to the cells to successfully carry out the tissue formation process. The growth media is usually rich in glucose and glutamine, compounds that are mandatory to achieve rapid cell growth. The cultured cells feed on glucose rapidly for their growth (Buchsteiner, Quek, Gray, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Nielsen, 2018). This is considered an inefficient process because of the low amount of energy obtained per glucose molecule consumed. The energy transfer ratio is 2:1 (2 moles of energy compound for one mole of glucose consumed), which is not efficient for culturing cells (Venkatesh, Darunte, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Bhat, 2013). This is also known as the “Warburg Effect”, where the increased glucose consumption by the cells leads to the increase in the accumulation of lactate, a toxic metabolic waste that damages the cells. Figure 3 shows the Warburg effect pathway.</p>

<p><a href=""https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-9863-7_703"">Fig.3. Schematic Representation of the Warburg Effect (Venkatesh et al., 2013)</a></p>

<p>Studies have shown that the increased accumulation of lactate affects the pH of the media, thereby leading to a hostile environment for the cultivated cells. In addition to the detrimental effect of lactate, accumulation of ammonia is also considered to impart cell damage. Cells utilize glutamine present in the growth media not only for the biosynthetic pathways of purine and pyrimidine synthesis but also as a major energy source. Cells utilize glutamine for their metabolism leaving behind ammonia as the metabolic waste (Schneider, Marison, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Von Stockar, 1996).</p>

<p>The accumulation of these two metabolic wastes in the media increases the toxicity of the media and causes tissue damage. To overcome the increased accumulation of lactate, the cells die and release an enzyme called Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts lactate into pyruvate (Legrand et al., 1992).</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Solution – “Co-culture system”</strong></p>

<p>Microalgae are autotrophic microorganisms that utilize carbon-di-oxide and nitrogen compounds and excretes oxygen during the photosynthesis process. They can be considered as “miniature plants” as they also use the photosynthesis process for producing valuable biocomponents. With this background, Haraguchi et al., (2017) conducted an innovative study where the mammalian cells C2C12 and Rat Cardiac Cell sheet are co-cultured along with microalgae, Chlorococcum littorale. Co-culture is a system where the mammalian cells and the microalgae are cultured in the same dish, as they proceed to grow and live by having close interaction with each other. This study shows that the co-culture system of mammalian cells and microalgae exhibits a symbiotic relationship, where the oxygen excreted by the microalgae got utilized by the mammalian cells and in turn, the microalgae utilize the mammalian metabolic waste – carbon-di-oxide and ammonia, for their photosynthetic process. In simple terms, the waste excreted by microalgae is utilized by the mammalian cells as a nutrient source and vice-versa for the microalgal cells. This efficient usage of waste metabolites has facilitated the mammalian cells to consume less glucose from the media, thereby reducing the lactate accumulation, which we discussed as toxic for the mammalian cells. Hence, the co-culture system has shown promising results by reduced cell damage (Haraguchi et al., 2017). Reduction of cell damage facilitates the cultivation of thicker cells that can be further processed to obtain the exact meat-like texture and therefore, achieve the meat-like sensory attributes like mouthfeel, flavor, taste, etc., Figure 4 illustrates the co-culture system used for the study.</p>

<p><strong>3-D Tissue Fabrication</strong></p>

<p>Haraguchi et al., (2021) conducted a study using the co-culture system where mammalian cell C2C12 and microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris, were cultivated to produce thicker cells. In that study, they found that the release of lactate dehydrogenase has been reduced to one-seventh compared to the normal mammalian cell cultivation. This means the cultivation of thicker cells with improved cell damage is possible via the co-culture system. Cultivation of thicker cells using animal cells alone leads to tissue damage due to the accumulation of toxic metabolic wastes like lactate. But the co-culture system has shown improved efficiency for fabricating thicker cells of 200-400 μm without incurring major tissue damage. This can be a potential tool for producing thicker and nutrient-rich cultured food (Haraguchi <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Shimizu, 2021). Thicker tissues provide better texture when subjected to the 3D fabrication process. Figure 5 displays the increased cell thickness produced by the co-culture system.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349959168_Three-dimensional_tissue_fabrication_system_by_co-culture_of_microalgae_and_animal_cells_for_production_of_thicker_and_healthy_cultured_food"">Fig. 5. Difference of tissue thickness between monoculture and co-culture (Haraguchi <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Shimizu, 2021)</a></p>

<p><strong>Recombinant Microalgae</strong></p>

<p>A study by Haraguchi et al., (2021) shows that the co-culture system shows reduced LDH production when the cells are cultivated at 30°C. At 37°C, the LDH production seems to be high due to the increased cell damage. As we have discussed earlier, the increase in lactate accumulation triggers the LDH release from the tissues by altering the pH of the media. To convert the lactate into pyruvate without damaging the cells, we propose the solution of making the microalgae release the LDH by recombinant technology (Valvona, Fillmore, Nunn, <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Pilkington, 2016).</p>

<p>Isolation of the gene LDH-A, which produces the LDH enzyme, from the mammalian cells and transferring it to the microalgal cells can be achieved via numerous methods like electroporation, Agrobacterium tumefaciens – mediated, particle bombardment, etc., Microalgal chloroplast genomes have been proven to be efficient for the expression of foreign proteins (Potvin <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Zhang, 2010), in our case, it is the LDH enzyme. This entire process is similar to the production of soy leghemoglobin produced by the Impossible for their burgers, but instead of soy leghemoglobin, we aim at producing LDH enzyme.</p>

<p>This can be a potential solution as the co-culture system has already been proved to be efficient for thicker tissue fabrication. In times of increased lactate accumulation, the microalgae will release the LDH in response to maintain the pH, thereby keeping the environment in the medium intact that is suitable for the growth of healthier tissues.</p>

<p>Intact thicker cells then can be harvested and processed to provide the necessary texture to provide the sensory needs that consumers expect from meat. The proposed solution aims at eliminating the toxic wastes that affect the tissues, thereby providing healthy tissues that exactly replicate the animal tissues in terms of texture and taste.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Cellular agriculture is an innovative field that comes with promising solutions for the global problems that we are facing currently. As an innovative field, it also possesses challenges that need to be solved by scientific work. The proposed solution of the co-culture system where the symbiotic relationship between the mammalian cells and the microalgal cells are achieved shows promising results that it can be used as a tool for fabricating thick and nutrient-rich cultivated meat. This could advance the rate of cellular meat cultivation to enter the consumer market soon.</p>

<hr />
<p>In many cultures, food presents a form of love and care and a way to bring people closer. This very personal relationship we have with food differentiates us from other living organisms for whom food just serves as a source of nutrition. However, in countries that suffer from food scarcity and famines, using food as comfort is often a luxury. In such developing communities, food security means economic growth, long-term health, and comfort. Food insecurity has detrimental effects on multiple aspects of the society.</p>

<p>Having reliable access to safe and nutritious food is a basic human need, which is why “Zero Hunger” is listed as a second goal by the United Nations (UN) under Sustainable Development Goals Initiative [1]. According to the UN, 2.37 billion people in the world do not have access to a healthy balanced diet in 2020 [2]. The global pandemic has only worsened this situation. An estimated 12.9% of the hungry population are from developing countries (Fig. 1). Entomologists determined that the high rate of population growth relative to agricultural productivity of a country, pest attacks, low capacity to store food products, low capacity to buy food staples from other sources, and climate change were among the leading causes for increased world hunger [3].</p>

<p>Many international organizations like the World Food Program (WFP), one of the largest UN agencies, is helping feed millions of people around the world. Meanwhile, smaller groups like The Hunger Project work to fight poverty and hunger in Asia, Africa, and South America. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation works towards food fortification and provides nutritious meals to Sub-Saharan African population. Even though they work in different places around the world, these organizations are united by a common goal: to eradicate hunger and make nutritious meals accessible to everyone. Despite these organizations working to reduce hunger, the world has seen a rise in hungry people in the past year owning to climate change and the pandemic. As stated by FAO, the prevalence of undernourishment climbed to 9.9% in 2020, which is up from 8.4% one year earlier [2]. This rise is not just because of the unavailability of food, it is also largely dependent on the affordability. Making food accessible and affordable has never been more crucial.</p>

<p>Food assistance programs need to not only focus on food security, but also nutrition security. Poor nutritional diet is a common cause of many chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. A balanced and healthy diet includes a mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other macronutrients. Protein intake plays an important role in the well-being of humans, especially children. Micronutrient deficiency is a commonly associated with a lack of balanced nutrition. This is seen more in developing countries than in developed nations. Increasing protein production to meet the demands of a growing population and making it available and affordable remains a challenge. This production demand is impeded by several threats ranging from deforestation and biodiversity loss to pandemics and antimicrobial resistance. Against the complexity and uncertainty of this situation, one thing remains clear: time to find a solution is running out.</p>

<p>The rapidly evolving science of cellular agriculture offers the possibility to solve many of the world’s protein-related dilemmas within a timeframe not otherwise on the table. However, realizing its promise will require overcoming barriers at the technical, policy, economic, and sociocultural levels. Consumer acceptance remains a major challenge in the implementation of cellular agriculture. The lack of consumer support stems from the emotions associated with the traditional methods of making food. Food neophobia is a major cause of non-acceptance of cultured meat among young adults. Increased acceptance of food largely depends on its affordability and organoleptic properties. Any new food innovation on the market needs to appeal to consumers in both ways.</p>

<p>To overcome the obstacle of price and increase consumer confidence in alternative methods of nutrition, my research focuses on developing meat products that meet or surpass traditional meat in cost, taste, availability, and quality. We apply engineering principles, specifically the controlling of mechanical and thermal behavior to produce innovative scaffolds. These scaffold designs are tuned to exhibit desired traits by modifying their shape and material properties. Currently, we are designing scaffolds that show negative thermal expansion to mimic the traditional behavior of shrinking meat during cooking. These polymer scaffolds are then used to manufacture ‘smart meat’. Why ‘smart’ though? Because it opens the possibility of having the right set of nutrients in a single product to fulfill dietary requirements. ‘Smart,’ because it would taste, look and feel like meat, but would be manufactured using cultured cells instead of slaughtered animals. ‘Smart,’ because we modify the materials and the contents to suit specific needs, ensuring balanced nutrition. Another way I am addressing food wastage is by ensuring that “smart meat” retains moisture for longer under heat to prevent overcooking. This is done by regulating the heat transfer in the meat product. We will study different biopolymers that can be used to culture meat and allow heat transfer within the meat to be controlled. These polymers will then be used to design scaffolds that exhibit a negative thermal expansion, i.e. they shrink when the temperature increases, just like how meat shrinks when cooked. Cultured meat that looks, feels, tastes, and cooks like regular meat is known as ‘smart meat’. The goal of this research is to make cultured meat attractive to consumers and reduce the hassle that goes into cooking a perfect piece of meat every single time. By improving consumer acceptance, the social stigma surrounding cultured meat is reduced. Increased acceptance leads to higher investments and eventually improved innovations and increased production. As demand and production increase, increased availability of cultured meat will reduce the current cost.</p>

<p>The second obstacle to overcome with my research is the affordability of cultured meat products. The manufacturing cost of the first ever cultured meat hamburger was $300,000 USD. Currently, the first commercially available lab-grown chicken nuggets are sold for $18 USD in Singapore by Just Eat. For someone in Australia, where the per capita income is $54,420, this price might not seem a lot, but when you look at it from the perspective of someone in Burundi, Africa earning a meager wage of $280, it is unaffordable. An efficient method of manufacturing can reduce the cost of a product significantly. To manufacture cultured meat products, we first look at the various methods of achieving the final cultured meat product. The infamous ‘Test-Tube Hamburger’ was made by combining hundreds of tiny little muscle fibers formed in a large bioreactor [5]. The muscle cells multiplied in a bioreactor to spontaneously fuse and form long fibers. This fusion allowed muscle cells to align in a directional manner like regular meat tissue. Another method of making cultured meat would be to use a foundational structure, or a scaffold, on which the muscle cells grow and align themselves. By using a scaffold, we eliminate the requirement of increasing the number of muscle cells required for spontaneous fiber formation. This spontaneity is assisted by the scaffold, where you add some muscle cells, allow them to grow, multiply and finally form the directional structure. The shape and design of the meat product can be modified by the scaffold structure. This also enables us to control the properties of the final product. Moreover, the scaffold materials can be modified to include all of the essential micronutrients to enhance muscle cell growth.</p>

<p>My research will aim to contribute to the overall goal of manufacturing affordable cultured meat by using cheaper alternatives for scaffold manufacturing. Traditionally, scaffolds are manufactured using extrusion, ink-jet printing, additive manufacturing, and chemical processing. These methods are time-consuming and expensive. We did an extensive survey of all available methods and additive manufacturing emerged as an economical method to fabricate scaffolds. Additive manufacturing is a fast and customizable method that is now being popularized for printing food. For the ease of accessibility, we used a commercially available benchtop printer to manufacture edible scaffolds to culture cells and grow meat tissue. The benchtop printer uses Digital Light Projection (DLP) method for printing, which uses an LED source to excite the scaffold material. The scaffold will include a light-sensitive chemical that causes the scaffold to solidify and form a rigid structure when excited. From this research, we aim to show that the manufacturing of cultured meat doesn’t require extensive lab spaces and equipment, and that it can be easy and accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>To fulfill the overarching goal of making meat at the touch of a button, we hope to bring a meat-printing machine to every household. The aim is to integrate and automate the whole process of manufacturing meat into a single tabletop machine. To elaborate, imagine an all-in-one minifridge- sized machine that includes storage, a manufacturing plant, and a processing plant. All one needs to do is pick the meat of choice and press a button. The machine will do the rest. This meatprinting machine will have an inventory of cells, scaffolds, and cell culture materials. It will then make the scaffold, seed the desired cells, and culture them in a built-in incubator. Processed material stock and the meat would remain in the incubator and the user would need regularly stock up on the raw materials just as one picks up groceries. Since all of the processes are done in a single machine, the risk of contamination is minimal.</p>

<p>A meat-making machine seems far-fetched in a broader view; however, it can be achieved by making science accessible to everyone. Setting up local cell banks that keep their cell lines growing and healthy, local stores that sell scaffold materials, and educating people on how to efficiently use these machines would help make cultured meat available to every household. Any improvement or changes to the machine can easily be shared with the world, removing all barriers that exist with food storage and exportation. This innovation potentially limits the demand on our existing agricultural systems to feed the growing population by offering an alternative method of balanced nutrition. With this drop-in demand, the current agricultural systems have reduced pressure to produce more food.</p>

<p>Food, as we know not just fills our stomach, but it fills our soul. Food is comfort, food is memory, food is culture, and food is pleasure. As humans, we are meant to enjoy every morsel we eat. However, when a large part of the population struggles to find food, enjoyment becomes a privilege. To end this disparity, many people and organizations are doing their part. Cultured meat is one innovative way for researchers and scientists to help with eliminating food inequality. Let’s aim to make science accessible, affordable, and attractive to solve the problems of food security in the modern world.</p>

<p>All meat is made from small biological machines called cells. Cells naturally grow in living organisms, like cows and sheep. As such, for most of human history, our way of obtaining cells for meat consumptions has been through animal agriculture. However, with the increasing demand for meat, animal agriculture had to industrialise on scales never seen before. This has led to new problems such as biodiversity loss and antimicrobial resistance. With developments of modern technology, cells can now be grown within lab cultures. Cultured cells are just like their animal counterparts – having the exact same appearance, structure, and function. As such, they too can be used to make meat for our everyday consumption. The farming of cultured cells for meat is known as cellular agriculture and offers potential solutions to problems encountered by our modern-day industrialised animal agriculture. However, these proposed solutions are not without their own challenges. One such challenge is cell optimisation — the task of growing cells faster and more efficiently. The inner workings of cells are often represented by signalling circuits, like that in Figure 1. Signalling circuits have vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities allow us to potentially influence cellular outcomes and fates. My research attempts to understand and predict where these vulnerabilities may lie in different circuits. For short, let us call this “circuit analysis”. Circuit analysis helps tackle the cell optimisation challenge by providing: predictions, biological insights and avenues into more “natural” optimisation methods.</p>

<p>Circuit analysis provides predictions of optimal cell behaviour. One way it does this is by quantitatively interpreting signalling circuits. Much of our understanding of the molecular processes occurring within cells come from diagrams called signalling circuits. Signalling circuits are like blueprints to the cell. They give us a qualitative description of what and where different processes occur — including processes important to farming cells like growth and proliferation. Therefore, to maximise our cell harvest while minimising resources spent, we must optimise these respective molecular processes. However, the qualitative description offered by circuit diagrams do not provide enough information to do so. Optimisation requires a quantitative description, rather than qualitative. Circuit analysis does just this. It transforms circuit diagrams into mathematical equations that tell us the conditions needed for optimum performance. These equations serve as predictive tools for minimising time and resources spent on culturing cells. Another way circuit analysis predicts optimal cell behaviour is helping design new circuit architectures. When a cell fails to behave in a desired way, we may need to modify its internal circuitry so that it exhibits desirable behaviours. Thus, if a cell takes too long to grow or consumes too many resources, it may need to be enhanced by modifying its circuitry. This modification requires knowing the right circuit architecture corresponding to the efficiency we desire. Fortunately, this can be calculated. Signalling circuits are like Lego. Similar to how smaller blocks can be assembled into larger blocks of desired architecture, smaller circuits can be connected into larger circuits of desired optimum conditions. Knowing the equations of two separate circuits means you know the equation of their connected pair. Knowing the equations of three separate circuits means you know the equation of their connected triplet, and so on. One can therefore obtain the equations, and hence predict the optimal conditions, for any circuit architecture required using only precursor knowledge of smaller circuits from circuit analysis. That is, circuit analysis provides building blocks to predict optimal conditions of new circuits. By allowing us to predict optimal cell behaviour in existing and new signalling circuits, circuit analysis can help farm cells faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>Circuit analysis can provide useful biological insights for cell optimisation. One example of this is with EGF-stimulated cells. EGF is a protein often associated with triggering cell proliferation. Stimulating a group of cells with EGF can help speed up their population growth and, hence, the harvest time for cells in a culture. However, for rat adrenal cells, EGF has been observed to trigger cell death in certain dosages [1]. This would present a problem if one were to try speed up cell production using EGF and end up doing the opposite. To explain this contradictory behaviour, my research attempts to study two special signalling circuits called the ERK pathway and the Akt pathway. These pathways are not unique to rat adrenal cells. They are common to a variety of cell types across many different species, including those in the meat we consume. As such, if we can identify the vulnerabilities causing cell death in these signalling circuits, then it may provide insight into how we can avoid triggering death when attempting to speed up population doubling time. A faster doubling time will mean less resources spent on running the bioreactor. As such, circuit analysis is a key to unlocking biological insights for optimisation applications.</p>

<p>Lastly, circuit analysis provides avenues into more “natural” optimisation methods. Cultured meat, by itself, already suffers from unacceptance due to its perceived unnaturalness and evoked disgust [2,3]. As beneficial as genetic modification can be for nutrition and food quality, adding GMO to the name may only deter hesitant consumers even more. To sway this target audience away from traditional meat and towards cultured meat, non-GMO cultured meat is perhaps the best compromise. This, however, takes away all the optimisation tools offered by tweaking the internal cell circuitry. Fortunately, noninvasive optimisation is still an option. One way circuit analysis helps with this is by exploiting signalling circuits connected to the cell surface, as opposed to the genes within the cell nucleus. A connection to the surface often means an interaction with the outside environment. This allows us to control cellular processes via external stimulation at these surface connections, like illustrated in Figure 2 (above). As an example, consider the ERK pathway mentioned earlier. The noninvasive method to activate the circuit would be to expose the cell surface to EGF and let that trigger the circuit, whereas the invasive method would be to probe into the cell and manually activate the proteins inside. If we can figure out how to obtain the same optimisation effect as genetically modifying a signalling circuit, from only clever use of external signals outside the cell, then we can avoid labels like that deter consumers like “GMO”. It is perhaps unlikely that “natural” and “unnatural” optimisation can achieve the same results, but it is a candidate bridge between traditional meat and “engineered” meat. Circuit analysis provides potentially useful tools for this bridge.</p>

<p>To solve the challenges of cell agriculture, we need to tackle the cell optimisation problem. Studying signalling circuits and identifying their vulnerabilities, offers an approach to optimising cells. It does this by providing three things: quantitative tools to predict conditions of optimal cell behaviour, biological insights for cell optimisation methods, and avenues for understanding “natural” optimisation. Achieving cell optimisation allows us to increase resource efficiency and scale up production. This in turn means more sustainable and affordable meat, encouraging the displacement of meat from our current unsustainable industrialised animal agriculture methods – freeing up land to restore biodiversity and mitigating the risk of practices that lead to medical issues like antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Hunger</strong></p>

<p>On a cool spring day, a baby girl is born in a rural town. She is left in the care of kind strangers at the local orphanage. Although the staff are well-intentioned, the orphanage is much too crowded. Children cry from different rooms, wanting to be fed. The caretakers hurriedly walk down the “assembly line” of infants, giving each baby a spoonful of food. The food is sparse, bland, and lacking essential ingredients for growing children. Without intervention, many of these children would not thrive or may not even survive. About a year later, a loving couple make the long and tiring journey to the orphanage to adopt the small girl. When they return home, however, the girl is so lightweight that she cannot be recorded on the growth chart and needs immediate treatment for an infection. What if the rural town had enough food for all of its residents? What if the orphanage was able to provide nutritious and safe food for all the children? How would having access to healthy food from a young age change the children’s future? Unfortunately this malnutrition occurs worldwide in similar scenarios, but the promise of cellular agriculture (CellAg) technology provides hope that someday this hunger will not be felt by others.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a couple of decades and the same girl is grateful to be writing to you now, remarkably as a happy and healthy adult, but faces a new challenge alongside the rest of the world—a global pandemic. This time, however, I am in a more fortunate situation, but cannot help feeling sympathetic towards the many families now facing hunger and waiting in long food bank lines. Seeing these never-ending food lines amplified the call-to-action to help find a solution, leading me to CellAg. I quickly became incorporated into the Cellular Agriculture Society (CAS) as a lead author for the Humanity chapter focusing on six United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger, of the forthcoming CAS cellular agriculture textbook (Gasteratos, 2022) and created an ongoing CellAg and food security project through the CAS fellowship program. As a scientist, CellAg presents the perfect opportunity to combine both of my passions: to fight food insecurity with science.</p>

<p>The pandemic exposed several weaknesses that CellAg can help strengthen. My project aims to provide a roadmap for CellAg distribution so that as many people as possible can benefit from this revolutionary technology, which could be a valuable tool in impoverished communities to combat food insecurity.</p>

<p><strong>Food Insecurity Research</strong></p>

<p>An estimated 840 million people will face hunger by 2030, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (FAO <em>et al</em>., 2020; Feeding America). Food security as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is “a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life,” which consists of four main components: availability, access, utilization, and stability (FAO <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Feeding America).</p>

<p>The first factor, availability, relates to food production and the amount of food present for consumption. CellAg offers a new method of generating food that could increase yield faster than traditional farming and reduce agricultural waste. Even countries with food surpluses, however, still suffer from high rates of food insecurity, demonstrating that addressing the other aspects of food security is essential (Hagedorn, 2019; McMichael, 2000).</p>

<p>The second factor, access, involves both geographic and economic distribution. CellAg may enable physical access to remote areas since cultivated meat is expected to have a longer shelf life than conventional meat. Shelf-stable, cell-based products could be made and transported farther away from consumers or alternatively the CellAg technology could be brought directly to locations that historically rely on imported food, creating more geographical independence (Gasteratos, 2019; Hagedorn, 2019; Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Many countries favor independence and are investing in technology to secure their food supply chains, a lesson also highlighted by the pandemic (Turrell, 2021). Economic accessibility will depend on price as expense continues to challenge CellAg, but if scaled properly cell-based meat may provide cheaper prices than conventional meat. In this case, farmed meat would become a premium product instead of CellAg items (Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020). If costs continue to decrease, then it is estimated that cultivated meat will reach conventional meat price parity by 2030 and can operate more sustainably than current farming methods (Brennan <em>et al</em>., 2021; Sinke and Odegard, 2021).</p>

<p>The third factor, utilization, describes the food’s nutritional value. Malnourishment, a metric for food insecurity, often involves “a lack of protein rather than a lack of calories” (De Boer and Aiking, 2011). Global malnutrition frequently occurs in low income countries that rely heavily on staple foods instead of on fresh produce and animal products (FAO <em>et al.</em>, 2020). The demand for meat is increasing within more developing countries and as the human population grows. By 2050, the world population is estimated to increase to about 10 billion people (FAO <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Hagedorn, 2019). Cell-based meat could possess identical or even enhanced nutritional values, such as healthy fat substitutions, compared to conventional meat or plant-based proteins (Day, 2013; Gasteratos, 2019; Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Overall food production closer to the communities it serves would also increase utilization by providing fresher and healthier, less processed food, which is a current obstacle for food deserts. Food insecurity in food desert neighborhoods is sometimes combated with access to one grocery store or even food sent via mail, but the available foods are processed, non-perishable, and expensive to transport (Fogarty, 2021). CellAg may offer fresh, healthy protein that would otherwise be too difficult to deliver to remote areas.</p>

<p>The final factor, stability, indicates the reliability of the food system. Food security encompasses additional issues, such as environmental sustainability and aspects of public health with food safety. With dwindling land availability, CellAg would be less dependent on natural resources and less vulnerable to climate change than conventional farming and could enable stability during natural and man-made disasters (Gasteratos, 2019; Hagedorn, 2019). Public health concerns, such as foodborne illnesses and zoonotic diseases, could be diminished through CellAg’s sterile production environment, further contributing to a stable long-term food system and possibly reduce the risk of future pandemics.</p>

<p>While all four factors are critical to comprehensive food security, as identified by others, food distribution appears to lie at the heart of the current food security problem (Hagedorn, 2019; McLellan, 2020). Geopolitical concerns surround the distribution of CellAg products and technology. Some essential questions about CellAg distribution include whether it will be centralized or decentralized and whether it will create a potential disparity that benefits only urban areas at the expense of rural communities (Hagedorn, 2019; Stephens <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>

<p>Researchers predict CellAg to impact urban and rural communities differently. If CellAg is produced in cities, urban areas could benefit from increased food availability, nutrition, and economic advantages. Rural regions may benefit from reduced climate pollution caused by conventional farming, but may also suffer from job and community loss related to local agriculture displacement (Hagedorn, 2019; Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Mass unemployment of farmers could lead to poverty and ironically food insecurity for the same people who have historically supplied food for communities. Collaboration instead of competition with farmers to establish regulation policies to prevent unemployment by transferring job skills could mitigate some of these potential negative aspects (Hagedorn, 2019; Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p>

<p>The disparity between urban and rural areas in the implementation of CellAg may also be extended globally. CellAg could increase the already existing economic and political power imbalance and allow for developed countries to monopolize power (Hocquette, 2016; Santo <em>et al.</em>, 2020). A shared united goal to advance CellAg, however, may promote unconventional collaborations with a unified mission (Clarkson, 2021). Designing “cookie-cutter” production facilities could aid in widespread distribution by providing quick, easy-to-build framework. Expansion of CellAg infrastructure may extend to developing communities, increasing resource access. Other research, such as generating meat for astronauts in outer space, may overlap and provide the technology needed to enable CellAg production in remote areas on earth as well. Widespread sharing—and democratization—of CellAg could reduce the concern of equal distribution of the technology (Brennan <em>et al</em>., 2021; Clarkson, 2021; Gasteratos, 2019; Shojinmeat Project).</p>

<p><strong>CellAg and Food Security Project </strong></p>

<p>My research interest is how CellAg can change food distribution for impoverished communities with the ultimate goal of providing food accessibility to all. The aim of my project is to compare and contrast different CellAg distribution models and to identify designs most promising to alleviate food insecurity. I hypothesize that decentralized, open-access, and democratized CellAg distribution will provide the greatest opportunity for CellAg to reduce food insecurity.</p>

<p>The different distribution strategies to be studied include centralized, semi-centralized, and decentralized:</p>

<p>A couple of centralized models have already broken ground and are under construction as pilot production plants with one company announcing that over 1,000 pounds of meat can be generated in one day. Other companies have envisioned plans to start building soon (Albrecht, 2021; Martin, 2021; “Our pilot plant,” 2021). The Cellular Agriculture Society’s Cell-based Meat Facility (CMF) project has created an ambitious blueprint of a potential plant in New York City to provide 2 billion pounds of meat annually (“Project CMF,” 2021; Talks at Google, 2019). Another large facility based on data from 15 current CellAg and industry-related companies is described as producing about 60,400 pounds of minced meat daily and creating 200 jobs with cost competitive and more environmentally friendly procedures compared to conventional meat operations (Sinke and Odegard, 2021; Vergeer, Sinke, and Odegard, 2021). Other cultured meat factories have also been designed and one highly detailed architectural project, The Carnery, describes a centralized area for CellAg production, education, research, and restaurant (Dunsford, 2020; Whiteside, 2017). The Carnery is portrayed as an urban hub in Dorchester, United Kingdom, that uses a closed energy system with recycled waste and solar, water, and electric power. In addition to the structural facilities for CellAg production, museum, and restaurant, The Carnery campus has space for an algae orchard and incorporated vertical farming. The Carnery is estimated to yield about 150 pounds of meat per day (Whiteside, 2017). The centralized models generally contain a cell production and harvesting process (tissue culturing, media growth in large bioreactors, scaffolding or 3D printing station), packaging area, and distribution center.</p>

<p>The semi-centralized models include a Cellular Agriculture Lifecycle Pod and pigs-in-the-backyard design. The pod is described as a solar-operated, net-zero-carbon, walk-through unit that produces food for the local community and acts as a social hub. The pod is a condensed version of the larger centralized plants equipped with small bioreactors, product processing, and drying room (Byrd, 2018). The pigs-in-the-backyard model could include small farms with a few animals that assist with the initial cell collection for the start of CellAg production at a local CellAg facility, such as a cultured meat barn (Dunsford, 2020; van der Weele and Driessen, 2013). The pigs-in-the-backyard strategy could also be utilized in crowded urban areas without much space (Shojinmeat Project).</p>

<p>Decentralized designs consist of individualized CellAg production. The Renaissance Farm manufacturing system is a hybrid between the semi-centralized and decentralized designs. The Renaissance Farm concept is similar to a CellAg vending machine where a food production device can be individually installed. The machine could then be maintained by the Food-as-Software idea in which different food formulas are downloaded from a central database (Scialom, 2021; Tubb and Seba, 2019). Other strategies for individualized CellAg include personalized CellAg kitchen devices and do-it-yourself online instructions from an open-access database (Dunsford, 2020; Shojinmeat Project). Individual meal packets, such as meals-ready-to-eat for the military or for astronauts, could also provide technology for individualized distribution.</p>

<p>Experts in both the CellAg and hunger relief fields will be surveyed with a standardized questionnaire to evaluate the different distribution models, including a scoring system for how helpful the designs may be for alleviating food insecurity. Since different models may work for different locations, regional experts will also be selected from impoverished areas to offer insight about how various distribution strategies might assist their communities. Based on the questionnaire data, the final objective of this study is to provide a blueprint for a CellAg model(s) that would best reduce food insecurity.</p>

<p>Food security encompasses numerous dimensions, particularly public policy and consumer acceptance. Policy surrounding CellAg will be key to ensuring equal distribution and smooth operation of CellAg facilities. Knowledge of local laws and culture can strengthen policy by customizing CellAg implementation for the target community, which may ultimately determine the success of a new food strategy (Guinto, 2021). Other challenges that contribute to food insecurity include poverty, poor health, and lack of housing (Martin, 2021). Successful food banks offer a central hub that address several needs, such as employment and health counsel to combat holistic sources of food insecurity, not just providing food (“How big food banks are defining the pantry of the future”, 2021). In addition to understanding the origins of food insecurity, effective food banks also foster consumer trust. Transparency and food choice are needed to establish consumer acceptance (Fogarty, 2021; The Good Food Institute, 2021; “How big food banks are defining the pantry of the future”, 2021). Food is personal, so research related to the people who will be eating the food and work towards alleviating interrelated issues are also critical to successfully strengthening food security.</p>

<p>Although food security is a multifaceted problem with no single solution, CellAg presents an opportunity to address some of the key challenges related to distribution to impoverished communities. This project will provide a roadmap for CellAg distribution that will facilitate the human right to food and reduce the risk of unequal distribution. Food is fundamental to life, as partially illustrated by my personal experience alongside my peers at the orphanage. Perhaps CellAg can play a significant role in providing this basic need to more people in the future and perhaps my work can aid in preventing other cases of childhood hunger, paying forward my good fortune.</p>

<p>1 INTRODUCTION AND RESEARCH BACKGROUND</p>

<p><strong>1.1 Challenges imposed by conventional meat production system</strong></p>

<p>Global meat production has become threefold since 1960, rising from 233 million metric tons in the year 2000 to 336.4 million metric tons in the year 2019 (Alexandratos <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Bruinsma, 2012; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2019). The exponential growth of the livestock meat sector poses a huge challenge to the sustainability of the food production system. The inefficiency of animal agriculture is a prominent issue, as up to 97% of calories of animal feed are lost for the production of inedible tissues, and up to 670 million tons of cereals are used as livestock feed annually, representing over one-third of total world cereal use which would be sufficient to feed 3.5 billion people if released for human use (Flachowsky et al., 2018; Schmidinger, 2012; Speedy, 2003). In addition, compared to plant-based food, animal based products have huge impacts on the environment, generating 14.5% of green-house gases, taking up 30% of Earth’s terrain and 8% of the global freshwater (Steinfeld et al., 2006). As the world expects a doubling of meat demand by 2050 (Steinfeld et al., 2006), traditional ways of meat production are hardly sustainable.</p>

<p>Another concern about animal-based products is their association with various public health issues, such as foodborne illnesses like swine and avian influenza, mainly due to the poor farming conditions unfit for animal welfare (Greger, 2007). Therefore, producing meat in a clean and sterile environment may prevent foodborne illnesses and improve food safety. Another health concern related to animal-based products is the overuse of antibiotics which leads to increased antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains. It is forecasted that by 2050, antimicrobial resistance will cause more deaths than cancer (O’Neill, 2014). Producing meat in a sterile environment and by using antibiotic-free media is therefore likely to significantly reduce the use of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Given the aforementioned concerns about sustainability, environmental burden and animal welfare caused by the conventional meat production through livestock, and the constant high demand for meat products globally, the urgency to explore alternatives to relieve the burden and pressure of livestock meat production is apparent. Therefore, producing meat in a clean and sustainable way is of special interest in public opinion, animal welfare organizations and the scientific community, and is also in line with the government’s development plan.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 Review of plant-based meat analogues</strong></p>

<p>There has been some progress on developing meat substitutes from plant-based sources such as soy (Riaz, 2005), legume (Kyriakopoulou et al., 2019), wheat (Malav et al., 2015) or mycoprotein (Quorn) (Finnigan, 2011). However, it appears difficult for these plant-based products to closely mimic the texture and taste of animal meat by using vegetable-origin proteins, fat and sugars (Elzerman et al., 2011), especially unable to mimic the textural profile of muscle fibres. The vegetable origin meat substitutes are therefore mainly being used in processed meats such as burgers, sausages or other types of minced products, but not in whole meat cut. In addition, plant-based products also lack equivalence with similar meat products in terms of the content of key nutrients such as essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins (Curtain <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Grafenauer, 2019), which is another major limitation for vegetarian/vegans and meat consumers alike.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 Clean meat as an appealing meat source</strong></p>

<p>Clean meat is meat produced in vitro, based on cell and tissue engineering techniques. It is composed of muscle tissue that is grown from initial cell cultures obtained from live animals and has gained increasing attention in the academia due to the potential ability to solve traditional animal agriculture problems. From a culinary perspective, clean meat is able to mimic animal meat products to recreate the characteristic sensations such as visual appearance, textural profiles, taste and aroma by growing different types of cells in a controlled and customizable platform (Ben-Arye <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Levenberg, 2019). The simple and precise manipulation of the in vitro cell culture environment would allow fine-tuning of meat traits to give rise to unprecedented flavours. From an environmental perspective, life cycle analyses find that cultured meat will have approximately 7-45% lower energy use, 78-96% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 99% lower land use, and 82-96% lower water use than conventionally farm-grown animals (Mattick et al., 2015; Tuomisto <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Teixeira De Mattos, 2011). From a technology perspective, during the last decades, tissue engineering and cell culture have been increasingly developed in the medical field, enabling lab-grown human tissues and organs. In 2014, the first clean meat prototype was successfully established from bovine satellite cells using tissue engineering and cell culture techniques (Post, 2014), proving the feasibility of these medical methods in clean meat production in the future.</p>

<p>Despite the superiority in environmental impact, the current clean meat field nonetheless faces several critical challenges. The first hurdle is the cost. The prohibitive cost of the biofabricated meat (up to $50,000 per pound) is the main obstacle for mass production of clean meat. The current method to produce clean meat is largely adapted from tissue engineering and cell culture which are two expensive methodologies in the medical field due to the high cost of biopolymers, growth factors, enzymes and numerous analytical molecules required. The adaptation of the high-cost medical technology to a relatively low-margin market – the food industry – is of serious concern regarding the cost-benefit of clean meat projects. The second hurdle is organoleptic properties, especially texture. According to a large-scale consumer insight report, taste is the most important attribute of meat alternatives, and the belief that meat analogues don’t taste good is the primary barrier to consumer adoption (Mintel, 2018). The current researches in the cell-based meat field, however, failed to focus on the sensory properties of their prototypes (Kyriakopoulou et al., 2021).</p>

<p>Therefore, clean meat production techniques need to focus on cost reduction while maintaining the functional properties (i.e. to recapitulate the sensory profile of real meat).</p>

<p><strong>1.4 Review of techniques to engineer clean meat</strong></p>

<p>Several techniques have been proposed to create meat-like structures. They can be roughly divided into 2 categories — mimicking the structure on larger length scales (i.e., top-down) or creating individual structural elements that are subsequently assembled into larger products (i.e., bottom-up) (Dekkers et al., 2018). The top-down strategies are able to mimic the structure of meat on larger length scales, but it has no resemblance to meat in terms of its primary, submicrometer architecture which is critical in providing the texture.</p>

<p>In contrast, the bottom-up strategies allow a more precise design of the meat structure by the use of structured scaffold to direct and support growing cells. By providing physical anchors for cell attachment and stretching, scaffolds can lead cells to differentiate and merge into elongated fibrous myotubes. The formation of myotube is regarded as the signal of initial development of muscle tissue and is the main structural configuration of muscle (Dekkers et al., 2018). In addition, by controlling meat structure and as an endogenous part of the final muscle tissue, scaffolds also make significant contributions to the textural properties to the final product. Hence, scaffolds are one of the best platforms to achieve both functional purposes. That being said, scaffold material is of crucial importance as it often decides how scaffold behave while being seeded cells and how consumers accept the sensory cues of the final product. Hence, attentions must be paid in designing the scaffold as the main component of the meat structure.</p>

<p>The current scaffolding technology use either a hydrogel or a macroporous, sponge-like biomaterial. Their drawbacks cannot be ignored. Specifically, the types of hydrogels that have been proved feasible for the development of cell-based meat are mainly animal-sourced (e.g. collagen and gelatin), the harvesting of which involves sacrificing animals. This is at crosspurpose of the clean meat field whose aim is free of cruelty. There is also a high cost incurred to purify these animal-derived hydrogel materials beforehand, which is the reason why it is far from being commercialized. Moreover, as hydrogels are soft materials that often support the formation of organoid but not a vascularized, highly structured muscle tissue due to technical limitations (such as the difficulty to deliver nutrient to the core of organoid and to control the alignment of muscle fibers), it often fails to provide the essential textural properties to the clean meat product (Kyriakopoulou et al., 2021). On the other hand, sponge-like, 3D biomaterials may be better at providing mechanical support to the tissue. Researchers have tried to use decellularized apple scaffold for fat tissue engineering and celery for tendon tissue engineering (Contessi Negrini et al., 2020). Plant being the base material also allows the opportunity for cost reduction in terms of raw material preparation. Nevertheless, the complexity of scaffold decellularization is probably the biggest hurdle that compromises its scalability. For instance, decellularization of a piece of spinach leaf involves 5 rounds of perfusion with 6 types of chemicals across 9 days (Gershlak et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Therefore, given the aforementioned challenges, the current scaffolding techniques for engineering a meat-like structure needs to focus on using an easy-to-scale-up and low cost method for scaffold establishment. In addition, since scaffold material is of crucial importance as it often decides how scaffolds behave while being seeded cells and how consumers accept the sensory cues of the final product, attention must be paid in choosing an edible material which has a meat-like texture itself as the main component of the meat structure. Overall, it is important to bear in mind that both scaffold and cells should synergistically improve the appearance and texture of the final product, and that cost reduction could be achieved in terms of using more cost-effective scaffold manufacturing techniques.</p>

<p>An appealing solution to this problem is using high moisture extrusion to develop a cell scaffold which not only has a meat-like fibrous structure that can provide the texture that can closely mimic that of the real meat but also can be manufactured at an industrial scale.</p>

<p>2 PROPOSAL – HIGH MOISTURE EXTRUDED SCAFFOLD FOR CELL-BASED MEAT</p>

<p>High moisture extrusion (HME) a technology for texturizing vegetable protein into a product with fibrous texture like animal meat. It is known to be a better method than conventional lowmoisture (dry) extrusion for enhancing the texture of meat analogue. By adding protein powders and water into twin screw extruders, the proteins undergo a process of mixing and hydration, thermal mechanical processing, and cooling (Cornet et al., 2021). In this process, the globular structure of proteins will be changed to fibrous structure by shear alignment (Beniwal et al., 2021). With the inherent aligned fibrous structure, high moisture extruded scaffold (HMES) has a meat-like fibrous structure. This fibrous structure, and the texture profiles, can be easily modified to be comparable to meat by simply optimizing the ingredients (Chiang et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Because of its comparable sensory profiles to meat and its high scalability, HME has already been utilized to make plant-based meat analogues that have been already commercialized. If it is used in the field of cell-based meat, we can expect the scaffold itself to provide major meatlike fibrous structure and texture profiles that are already widely accepted by consumers. In this way, the gap between novel clean meat product and consumers are largely narrowed.</p>

<p>Hence, The edibility, sustainability and scalability of high moisture extruded scaffold (HMES) is likely to help to address the inherent challenges in the clean meat field by making the final product more meat-like and cost-effective.</p>

<p>In terms of the ability to support cell growth, researchers have demonstrated that textured soy protein as a scaffold material can support growth and differentiation of bovine satellite cells (Ben-Arye et al., 2020) without cytotoxicity. Hence, applying HME using plant protein (such as soy or wheat protein) as the base material is likely to be non-cytotoxic and may support cell attachment and growth. At the same time, the fibrous structure of HMES can closely recapitulate the microenvironment of muscle tissue and could be supportive for the merge and differentiation of muscle cells.</p>

<p><strong>2.1 Preparation of scaffold from sliced HMES sheets</strong></p>

<p>By adding protein powders and water into twin screw extruders, the proteins undergo a process of mixing and hydration, thermal mechanical processing, and cooling (Cornet et al., 2021), and the primary product is an extruded protein bars. The protein bars are not suitable to be directly used for cell culture as their structures are too thick (&gt; 1cm) and compact. With this thickness and its solid compact structure, there is limited space for cell penetration and diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. Thus, further treatment of HME protein bars are required to prepare scaffolds proper for cell culture.</p>

<p>The HME protein bars can be either cut into small blocks or sliced into thin sheets for use as scaffolds. By reducing the size, limitations for cell penetration and diffusion of nutrients and oxygen can be remediated. The only concern of cutting the HME protein bars into small blocks is that it will be labour-intensive to assemble these blocks to build whole-cut meat, since the size of each block is only a few millimetres. Thus, we propose another potential method by slicing the HME bars into thin pieces and do a 2D cell culture on the surface. By doing so, only the dimension in thickness should be controlled at the millimetre scale for cell penetration and nutrients transport, the width and length can be increased. After cells are seeded onto the scaffold, multiple layers of HME sheets containing cells can be simply stacked together and made into meat cut. This stacking method will save much time and cost compared with assembly of small blocks.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Cell culture on HME scaffold</strong></p>

<p>Scaffolds prepared by HME should be supportive for the culture of satellite cells (also known as muscle stem cells). The highly aligned fibrous structure of HME scaffold can help align satellite cells into tubular orientation and thus support it to differentiate and merge into myotubes (Ben-Arye <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Levenberg, 2019). In addition, previous researches on protein-based scaffold has proved that protein as scaffolding material can support cell growth and differentiation of bovine satellite cells (Ben-Arye et al., 2020) without cytotoxicity. Hence, it is obviously feasible to use protein as a base material for HME scaffolds (HMES), although how different types of proteins would affect cell viability and differentiating ability is pending to study further.</p>

<p>To meet the requirement of scalability, there are two ways. The first way is to increase the size of each HMES sheet, the second is to increase the number of HMES sheets in each preparation round. For the first one, the size of width and length of individual building block would be expected to achieve several centimeters to ten centimeters. However, culturing only one sheet at a time is time-consuming, it is more feasible to increase the number of HMES sheets for each scaffold by decreasing the size of each sheet. Hence, we propose to use a chamber with multiple layers, each layer containing only one HMES sheet. This chamber can be linked with a reservoir containing culture medium and a pump to transport the medium, and multiple HMES sheets can be cultured in one chamber simultaneously. This process can be further scaled up by increasing the number of chambers. The viability of using reservoir and pump to transport medium and support muscle cell culture has been tested in another research (Schuster et al., 2017).</p>

<p><strong>2.3 Fabrication of whole-cut meat by HMES sheets with cells</strong></p>

<p>After culturing satellite cells on HMES sheets, each of these sheets is a building block for the final whole-cut meat. By stacking multiple building blocks and binding them with edible materials, a whole-cut meat can be fabricated. Transglutaminase is an edible meat cross-linker in the meat industry and has been applied in recent research to bind cell fibers for fabrication of meat analogue (Kang et al., 2021). Hence, we would like to propose to use transglutaminase as a binding material for HMES sheets. The transglutaminase can be made into solution state and brushed or sprayed with a fixed amount on top of each HMES sheet. This stacking and binding process is quick, can be easily operated and has a potential for automatization, and is therefore scalable. The final whole-cut meat product is expected to have the desired meat-like texture and structure, and this can be tested by using a characterization machine and rigorous sensory evaluation tests.</p>

<p>3 IMPLICATIONS OF OUR PROPOSAL</p>

<p><strong>3.1 HMES can provide a meat-like structure and texture to the final product</strong></p>

<p>Supporting cell culture is an essential functionality for scaffolds from the perspective of tissue engineering, but in terms of cell-based meat, the structure of scaffolds should provide the basic meat-like texture on top of cell-supporting functionality. Because the scaffold is making up a major component in the final meat cut, its structure and texture will directly influence the structure and texture of the final product (which are the two most important criteria for consumer acceptance) (Mintel, 2018). Previous researches did not pay much attention to the structure and texture of scaffolds. Hereby we propose, by using a scaffold with meat-like fibrous structure and texture through HME, the structure and texture profiles of cell-based meat can be expected to be largely improved. Meanwhile, by using this kind of material, we would also like to draw more attention on optimizing the structure and texture of scaffolds in cell-based meat, instead of just focusing on improving the ability to support cell culture.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 HMES is superior in terms of scalability and sustainability for cell-based meat</strong></p>

<p>To meet the requirement of meat supply, scaffold fabrication must be scalable and high throughput. To fulfil the requirement of sustainability, scaffold material should be easily accessible and not animal based. HME is already employed by manufacturers on a large scale in the plant-based meat analogue industry. By using it as a scaffold, the scalability of the scaffold is promised. In addition, the material for HME is highly flexible. Many plant proteins can be applied, including soy proteins, pea proteins, wheat proteins and lupin protein (Cornet et al., 2021). These proteins are easily accessible with low cost and are often regarded as an healthier choice by consumers. Hence, scaffolds from HME are likely to be highly sustainable and readily accepted by consumers.</p>

<p>4 CONCLUSION</p>

<p>In conclusion, the current focus for clean meat production should be cost reduction while maintaining the functional properties (i.e. to recapitulate the sensory profile of real meat), given that the two main hurdles for the current clean meat prototype to be commercialized are the high cost and the inferior textural profile. By controlling meat structure and as an endogenous part of the final muscle tissue, scaffolds can significantly contribute to the textural properties to the final product. Hence, it is important to understand that both scaffold and cells should synergistically improve the appearance and texture of the final product, and that cost reduction could be achieved in terms of using more cost-effective scaffold manufacturing techniques. In this essay, we propose to use HME as a technique to manufacture a highly structured scaffold for cell-based clean meat so that the structure and texture profiles of cell-based meat can be expected to be largely improved while at a relatively low cost. More importantly, we would like to appeal for researchers in this field to pay more attention on optimizing the structure and texture of scaffolds in cell-based meat, instead of solely focusing on its functionality to support cell culture. After all, everything will eventually boil down to commercialization and industrialization.</p>

<hr />
<p>Less meat, less heat. It is becoming increasingly recognized and proven that a reduction of meat consumption would be extremely beneficial to the climate, food security, animal welfare, the environment, biodiversity, and global health. Notwithstanding these essential advantages, meat retains its substantial share in contemporary Western diets. The average Dutch person consumes meat 6 days a week (RIVM, 2020). The persistence of this habit can be explained by the fact that people believe eating meat is natural, normal, necessary and nice (Piazza et al., 2015). Even though vegetarianism has gradually become more popular and accepted (Leitzmann, 2014), meat consumption remains the social norm. At the majority of organized dinners and events, meat is the default menu option. In most cases, vegetarians are asked to indicate their preferences for an alternative plant-based menu in advance, so that the organizers can make sure vegetarian options will be served at the occasion, too. This procedure can influence the choices that people make, as people have a tendency to stick with the given default option (Dinner, Johnson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Goldstein, 2011). In order to reduce meat consumption, Dutch senator prof Henriette Prast proposed to reverse this common default by making plant based meals the default option at organized dinners, and enabling meat- or fish lovers to request a non-vegetarian alternative dish in case they so desire (e.g. Prast, 2009). When this design was tested in a scientific experiment, it led much more people to eat vegetarian at the occasion than when the default menu contained meat and dairy (Hansen, Schilling <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Malthesen, 2019). Given the societal importance of this finding, scientific replications of the effect are crucial. Yet insight in these mechanisms could be part of the solution to make meat more obsolete.</p>

<p><em>Default effects</em></p>

<p>The default effect refers to “the tendency to stick with the option that takes effect if one does not make an explicit choice” (Li <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Chapman, 2013). A considerable quantity of scientific studies has been conducted on this effect. For example, there is a substantial body of research comparing opt-in and opt-out organ donation systems. The results are consistent: opt-out systems lead to much more organ donors than opt-in systems (e.g. Davidai, Gilovich <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Ross, 2012; Johnson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Goldstein, 2003; McKenzie, Liersch <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Finkelstein, 2006). Other examples of areas in which default effects have been investigated are retirement program designs (Madrian <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Shea, 2001) and lighting product choices (Dinner, Johnson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Goldstein, 2011). The participants in these studies were shown to opt for the default significantly more often than for the alternative option. Similar effects have been found in the context of food consumption, which has important societal implications as the use of vegan defaults has the potential to significantly reduce meat and dairy consumption.</p>

<p>The default effect is an example of irrational decision-making, as it illustrates a situation in which people do not decide according to their own best interest but are rather affected by a somewhat arbitrary external stimulus – the default. One potential explanation for this effect is that when people are faced with too many decisions, they tend to rely on simple heuristics to make their decision (Herman et al., 2009).</p>

<p>Several studies have examined various specific heuristics that may explain the default effect. People may perceive defaults as recommendations or suggestions from the policymakers or organization that set them. This impression has also been referred to as <em>implied endorsement</em> (McKenzie et al., 2006). In addition, sticking with the default requires less effort for the decision maker (Samuelson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Zeckhauser, 1988). After all, it prevents the individual from having to evaluate the available options. Finally, default options can influence perceived social norms, as Everett et al. (2015) found that defaults are perceived as socially normative options.</p>

<p><em>Effort</em></p>

<p>Individuals have to make approximately 200 food choices each day (Novak <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Brownell, 2011). We have to decide <em>when</em> we eat, <em>where</em> we eat, <em>what</em> we eat, and <em>how much</em> we eat. An overburden of decisions leads people to simplify the decision-making process. Therefore, it seems likely that a default menu option offers a tempting choice, as it exempts people from having to decide. Especially if participants feel like it is too much effort to switch to the alternative menu option, a significant proportion of them will stick with the default menu option regardless of the ingredients of this menu, as it discards the need for option evaluation. Results will likely not apply to participants with strong preferences such as vegans or meat lovers, defaults are unlikely to be influential for people with strong preexisting attitudes (Vetter <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Kutzner, 2016). Nevertheless, it is expected that overall the default effect should be stronger when the effort required to switch to the alternative menu option is high.</p>

<p>The importance of effort in food contexts has also been illustrated by the “proximity effect”, which refers to the finding that placing snack-food further away from individuals decreases their consumption of that food (Maas, de Ridder, de Vet <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> de Wit, 2012). The healthy option should be easier to obtain than the unhealthy option.</p>

<p><em>Social norms</em></p>

<p>Another reason for the appeal of default options is that people may interpret the default as an indication of what others choose. This suggests that in my experiment, the default menu option will be perceived as more socially normative than the non-default menu option.</p>

<p>The influence of social norms on food choice was also pointed out by Mollen, Rimal, Ruiter <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Kok (2013), who found that meal choice is susceptible to printed social norm messages. The experiment looked at two types of social norms: <em>descriptive norms</em> and <em>injunctive norms</em>. Descriptive norms refer to the behavior that we observe among most others in our environment, whereas injunctive norms concern the behavior we believe is approved or disapproved of by others (Cialdini, Reno, Kallgren, 1990). Mollen et al. (2013) found that in an on-campus food court, a poster describing a healthy descriptive norm positively predicted healthy food choices. When the poster read a healthy injunctive norm, it did not significantly improve food choices. In line with these findings, it has been proposed that injunctive norms are less important in quick food decisions</p>

<p>Christie <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Chen (2018) found that people have a tendency to order dishes that other people choose as well. Interestingly, this study looked specifically at vegetarian and non-vegetarian lunch options. The results showed that participants frequently mimicked the order placed by the person ahead of them in line, regardless of whether this person ordered a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian meal. The participants conformed to the norm they observed in front of them.  Choosing a plant based menu will then no longer deviate from the social norm. Therefore, it is expected that the default being perceived as socially normative will subsequently increase the likelihood of that food option being chosen.</p>

<p><em>Current study</em></p>

<p>My experiment was centered around the following research question: “What is the effect of having non-vegetarian compared to plant based meals as the default menu option at organized dinners on meat consumption, and how can this effect be explained?”. It bridged a gap in the literature by contributing empirical findings concerning causes of default effects in food contexts in three ways. It replicates default effects in food choice, provides a causal test of the role of effort in default effects on food choice, and tests the role of social norms in this process. In addition to this scientific value, this specific research area also has societal relevance as it provides empirical evidence on a potential strategy to stimulate the necessary reduction of meat consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p><em>Participants</em></p>

<p>The participants were recruited from an online test panel of over 65,000 members who voluntarily subscribed to the panel to share their personal experiences, opinions and judgments about products and services. A total of 23,565 people participated in the experiment that was completed online (52.1% female). Age was provided as a categorical variable ranging from ‘younger than 18’ to ‘older than 66’, with intervals of 10 years. More than three quarters of the participants was 56 or older (76.1%). The mode age category was ‘older than 66’. Almost half of the sample was employed (48.5%), whereas 37.1% was retired and 14.4% was unemployed.</p>

<p><em>Experimental Manipulation</em></p>

<p>The experiment had a 2 (default: meat vs. vegetarian) by 2 (effort: high vs. low) full-factorial between-subject design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these four conditions. In all conditions, participants were asked to imagine the same scenario. They would receive an e-mail from a current or former employer which included an invitation to an annual staff dinner at which the company’s performance throughout the past year would be reviewed, and the 40th anniversary of the company would be celebrated. In order to make sure retired participants would feel included too, the email invited former colleagues to the event as well. The part of the e-mail text including information about the date, location and program of the evening was identical across conditions. The e-mails differed between conditions in two aspects. First of all, each email announced a default menu option, which, depending on the condition the participant was in, was either a meat menu (<em>meat default</em> condition) or a vegetarian menu (<em>vegetarian default</em> condition). Everyone at the dinner would be served the same menu, except for the attendees that would indicate beforehand to prefer the alternative menu instead. Second, the invitations also varied with respect to the amount of effort required to switch to the alternative menu option. In the <em>low effort</em> condition, participants could request the alternative menu by merely clicking a link in the email. In the <em>high effort</em> condition, the email asked them to visit the company’s website, look for a form under the heading ‘staff dinner’, and to fill it out and submit it.</p>

<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>

<p>Overall, a significant main effect of default menu option was found, such that participants showed a tendency to stick with the default menu option regardless of what the default was. Presenting participants with a vegetarian default menu increased vegetarian choice from 21% to 52% compared to a meat default condition. This effect was partially mediated by descriptive social norms: the default menu option was perceived as being more popular than the alternative menu option, which led participants to opt for the default menu option themselves significantly more often.</p>

<p>The main effect found was consistent with previous literature on default effects (e.g. Johnson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Goldstein 2003; McKenzie, Liersch <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Finkelstein 2006, Dinner, Johnson <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Goldstein, 2011), as the default option was chosen significantly more often than the alternative option. Thereby, the findings confirm the existence of a default effect in food choice. The outcome indicates that a vegetarian default menu option provides an effective way to reduce meat consumption at organized dinners. It more than doubled the number of participants opting for the vegetarian menu. This suggests that practitioners can stimulate healthy and sustainable food choices merely by serving meat on request rather than by default. Introducing the vegetarian default menu in organizations would enable the implementation of this policy at a large scale. Depending on the dissemination of this measure, this could lead to a drastic reduction of meat consumption.</p>

<p>In fact, the current sample showed a tendency to stick with the default option when it was easy to request the alternative menu option, and to request the alternative option when it required a lot of effort. Perceived descriptive social norms mediated the relationship between default menu option and menu choice, whereas perceived injunctive social norms did not. This means that participants thought the default menu option would be chosen more frequently by others than the alternative menu option, which subsequently led participants to opt for the default themselves as well.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Because a reduction of meat consumption would be beneficial to a variety of areas such as global health and sustainability (Godfray et al., 2018), the current study investigated whether offering vegetarian menus by default at organized dinners could discourage people from choosing to eat meat. In an online experiment among 23,565 participants, a vegetarian default menu option increased the vegetarian choice from 21% to 52%. This effect of default menu option on food choice was partially mediated by descriptive social norms. Participants felt like the default menu option was chosen more often by others than the alternative menu option, which led them to opt for the default menu themselves too. The role of the effort of switching to the alternative option may be surprising and requires further investigation. In sum, these data suggest that offering a vegetarian instead of meat default menu option may be an effective and easy to implement way to reduce meat consumption at organized dinners.</p>

<hr />
<p>Studying abroad in Costa Rica for two years in high school was the impetus for me to realize the close relationship between food, particularly proteins, and health. One of the things which surprised me was that whenever I walked around towns there, I saw far more overweight people than I did in Japan, where I grew up. The Global Nutrition Report states that Costa Rica has a high obesity rate with about 21.1% of adult men and 30.4% of adult women struggling with obesity (“Country Nutrition Profiles”). I thought about the reason behind this high rate, and then I realized that the eating habits in Costa Rica are very different from those in Japan, which has only 4% of the obesity prevalence rate (“Lower Prevalence”). For instance, the proportion of carbohydrates per meal is high and that of protein is low for Costa Rican meals on average. Most of the traditional food there contains a lot of carbohydrates like Gallo Pinto, which is a traditional breakfast made from rice and beans. This habit causes the amount of protein intake to be low, and also the protein sources are often fatty or fried meat. This was just my guess about the high obesity rate in Costa Rica, but as I further gained knowledge by myself, I encountered an idea of the protein leverage hypothesis, which states that a decline in the ratio of protein intake to carbohydrate and fat causes excess energy intake, which may lead to obesity (Gosby et al. 1). Although this is not the only reason for the high obesity rate, this learning experience made me desire to produce new healthy food, especially protein.</p>

<p>As the situation in Costa Rica suggests, intaking balanced nutrients, including proteins, is important for preventing diet-related noncommunicable diseases. However, there are several issues and obstacles that we need to overcome in order to achieve the future where all people, including people in developing countries, have enough protein sources and take nutritionally balanced meals. I believe that cultured meat can contribute to solving these issues. Cultured meat is made by growing muscle cells of livestock in the lab. I have been studying and researching cultured meat as an undergraduate student. In this essay, I argue that cultured meat can be our future protein source which proposes a new possibility of protein as medicine as well as creates a sustainable protein supply system.</p>

<p>Cultured meat can be an innovative way of preventing or curing lifestyle diseases caused by imbalanced nutrition by supplying meat that has optimized and personalized nutrition for each person. Meat is one of our most common protein sources, but at the same time, eating meat can cause noncommunicable diseases. For instance, it is said that high consumption of red beef raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes (“What’s the Beef”). Although people should be aware of the nutrition of their diets and change what they eat if necessary, it is not always easy for people with or without lifestyle diseases to suddenly change their eating habits, especially for people who love eating meat. Additionally, planning a different menu for a person who has nutritional issues is troublesome for the person as well as for their family members who make meals. The person also might feel excluded by eating different meals from their family members at the table. Cultured meat can reduce people’s stress of changing meals by supplying meat which looks exactly the same as the traditional meat but contains more or different nutrients. Since cultured meat is made by growing cells in the lab, it is theoretically possible to design its composition by adding different nutrients. For instance, we could remove saturated fats, which may increase the risk of heart disease, and instead add polyunsaturated fats like plant-based fats and DHA, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Lamarco). In this way, we will be able to produce cultured meat which contains personalized and optimized nutrients depending on the person’s needs and health condition. People can prevent disease by eating these nutritionally balanced cultured meats. This is not possible for the current animal agriculture system which makes meat directly by killing animals. Moreover, researchers are trying to make cultured meat be cooked and look exactly the same as traditional meat. Thus, people will not have to experience the trouble of serving meats by different cooking methods nor ever feel isolated by eating different foods with other people. Being able to choose nutritionally enriched cultured meat in stores could be an easy first step for people to change their eating habits for their health.</p>

<p>Cultured meat not only solves the problem of nutritional imbalance, but also can be a solution to a significant issue of the protein industry: there will be a lack of protein supply in the coming years because the current livestock production is not sustainable. According to the Population Division of the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow by 2.3 billion people by 2050 (“Global Agriculture”). Having more people implies we will need more food than now, but it may not be realistic to satisfy the growing food demand by continuing the current ways of producing food, especially meat, an important protein source. About 70% of all agricultural land is used for meat production, and 18% of greenhouse gas emissions come from this industry (Fernández). Being so unsustainable, meat production would still need to grow by over 200 million tons by 2050, and about 70 % of the increase would occur in developing countries (“Global Agriculture”). However, the current livestock industry is not sustainable enough to feed the growing population. One of the reasons is that the worldwide high demand for meat has caused environmental destruction, especially for developing countries. For instance, the high demand for beef in the US has led to deforestation in Costa Rica (Gerber et al. 80). In order to export more beef, the forested lands have been converted to cattle pastures. Another main reason is that growing farm animals consumes a lot of resources like feed and water. More than 1,500 gallons of water are used to produce one pound of beef (Howie). 36% of the world’s crop calories are used for animal feed (Plumer). These numbers imply how inefficient the current livestock production is for feeding people.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to find a new way of sustainably producing meat in order to feed about 10 billion people in the future. I believe that cultured meat is a great way to help us make the future possible. First of all, cultured meat is made entirely in the lab. Thus, we do not need huge lands like ranches to produce meat. This advantage will solve the issue of transforming lands into farms and causing environmental destruction. It will also be possible to produce meat in the middle of big cities as long as we can find a place there to build a lab. This will contribute to increasing countries’ food self-sufficiency rate, and cultured meat will be a valuable protein resource especially in the case of natural disasters. Secondly, since cultured meat is made by taking some cells from living animals and growing them outside of animals’ bodies, we do not need to grow as much livestock as the current animal agricultural system. This means that by making cultured meat instead of killing farm animals, we can reduce the amount of resources used for meat production. Finally, since cultured meat is made in aseptic conditions like the lab, it is free from infections caused by bacteria like Salmonella (Chriki and Hocquette 3). We could also reduce the risk of animal contact breakout because we would only use a few livestock for producing cultured meat. For these reasons, cultured meat is a more sustainable and safer way of producing meat, which will help us to continue supplying proteins even when the world population rapidly grows.</p>

<p>Cultured meat has a lot of potential as our future protein source, but it also has obstacles to overcome to be actually eaten in the near future. As an undergraduate student, I have been studying and researching cultured meat in order to solve these obstacles and make cultured meat a practical future protein source which resolves the issues of the current protein industry. In my university, the University of Pennsylvania, I study chemistry as a major and nutrition as a minor. I am studying nutrition in order to learn the nutritional values of food, especially meat, as well as noncommunicable diseases related to nutrition. Since the nutrition courses of my university are offered by the Nursing school, I have been able to learn not only the functions of various nutrients, but also how diets can work as disease prevention. For example, in a class named “Nutrition: Science <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Applications,” I learned what kinds of proteins like ghrelin are involved in food intake regulation and obesity. Acquiring this kind of knowledge will help me in the future to produce cultured meat which contains different kinds of nutrients for each person. I believe that studying chemistry in addition to nutrition allows me to further understand what will happen to the nutrients of cultured meat in our bodies and when cooked by learning the chemical structures and reactions of nutrients. Outside the university, I have been conducting research on cultured meat since last year at the Institute of Advanced BioMedical Engineering and Science in Japan. My current research evaluates the influence of temperature on the efficiency of growing bovine muscle cells. I hope this research makes it possible to produce more cultured meat in a shorter period of time in the hope of contributing to resolving the issue of the lack of protein supply in the future.</p>

<p>Although its technology is still being developed, I believe that cultured meat will solve the protein-related issues by suggesting a new way of how protein can be medicine and creating a new sustainable protein supply system. One of my future goals is to solve the issue of obesity in Costa Rica by incorporating cultured meat with nutrients I designed to Costa Rican people’s diets. I would like to continue learning about cultured meat in the hope of contributing to a better world by improving people’s diets and health.</p>

Although seaweeds have been consumed for millennia, they’re increasingly (and rightly) viewed as a hero ingredient. With only half a dozen species cultivated at scale right now, seaweed’s potential for the alt-protein industry is only just starting to unfold.","<p>Seaweed aquaculture is the world’s <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00100/full"">fastest-growing food sector</a>, with its yearly production volume growing at a rate of 8-10%. More people are discovering that farming seaweed is a viable livelihood, and the number of its applications is growing as the body of research on its uses expands into food, feed, fertilizer, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, textiles, pigments, plastics, construction materials, and more. As the world frantically seeks to decarbonize, seaweeds have increasingly been touted by scientists and entrepreneurs alike as a critical piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the alternative protein space, it’s the potential of <em>micro</em>algae that has thus far received the majority of the attention. These microscopic biological cousins of seaweed (itself a <em>macro</em>algae) are currently being explored by a number of startups working on <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/nurturing-proteins-algae-and-mycelia"">cell-culture media</a> for cultivated meat, and as ingredients in <a href=""https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2021/09/22/Tofurky-teams-up-with-Triton-Algae-Innovations-for-algae-fueled-meat-innovations-set-to-launch-in-Q1-2022"">plant-based meat</a> products, <a href=""https://www.wales247.co.uk/project-reveals-how-algae-could-play-crucial-role-in-sustainable-food-production"">animal feed</a>, and other <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-58748128"">food applications</a>. </p>

<p>But controlled cultivation of microalgae often requires expensive facilities with advanced equipment and a highly educated staff to operate. Seaweed, on the other hand, can be cultivated in open bodies of water, such as the ocean. Although seaweeds have been consumed for millennia, they’re increasingly (and rightly) viewed as a hero ingredient. Let’s take a closer look at their significant untapped potential in the alt-protein space. </p>

<p><strong>The environmental benefits of seaweed aquaculture</strong></p>

<p>The foremost (and most self-evident) benefit is that seaweeds grow in the ocean and so they don’t require fertile soil or fresh water to grow — both of which are resources in increasingly short supply. </p>

<p>Notably, seaweeds take up nutrients from the water; no pesticides or fertilizers need to be added. They can be grown as part of a polyculture — with shrimp or salmon farms, for instance, where the seaweeds absorb the excess nutrients from these animals — or they can help clean up the excess fertilizer from agricultural wastewater run-off that washes into the sea, a process known as bioremediation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, seaweeds are algae, and algae were the original photosynthesizers before they crawled on land and turned into plants and trees. This means they take up carbon dioxide. The picture around the carbon sequestration potential of seaweed aquaculture <a href=""https://www.oceans2050.com/seaweed"">will take a bit longer to form</a> but, at a minimum, seaweed offers great potential to <a href=""https://seaweedclimatesolution.com/"">decarbonize existing industries</a> by replacing petroleum-derived products with, for instance, seaweed-based bioplastics. </p>

<p>Seaweed farms also provide habitat and a nursery for fish, increasing biodiversity by 40% and species abundance by 30%, according to <a href=""https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/tnc-restorative-aquaculture-can-improve-marine-habitats-biodiversity/"">a recent TNC study</a>. Farms can also serve as a coastal defense, acting as living breakwaters, which might <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12483"">help mitigate future flooding risks</a> as ocean levels rise.  </p>

<p>Finally, seaweed farming provides income to millions of families in rural coastal communities in Asia and Africa. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320301776_The_role_of_women_in_seaweed_aquaculture_in_the_Western_Indian_Ocean_and_South-East_Asia"">In most developing countries, the majority of people involved with seaweed farming are women</a>, with men often preferring the fast daily income that fishing brings. This has enabled women to become economically active and <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09670262.2017.1357084"">achieve a degree of independence</a> and emancipation that was not available to them before, in areas where few opportunities exist. Further, while initially less lucrative than daily fishing income due to the steep and often protracted learning curve involved in farming and cultivation, these “seaweed women” ultimately enjoy a more stable income which can balance the effects of fishing’s unpredictable outcomes on household finances. </p>

<p>Wild seaweed stocks do not allow for further growth, meaning seaweed aquaculture is the only way forward for the industry to grow. For now, seaweed farming outside Asia is minimal but there is a concerted push to make <a href=""https://phyconomy.net/database/"">the seaweed industry</a> succeed across the world. Whether it’s Australia, Canada, Belize, Brazil, Norway, or Namibia, pioneering governments, scientists, and entrepreneurs are looking to build up this new industry.</p>

<p><strong>Seaweeds in the alternative protein industry</strong></p>

<p>The ability to extract proteins from seaweed to create drop-in protein pastes <a href=""https://www.dtu.dk/english/news/2019/03/dynamo-theme-4-from-seaweed-to-proteins"">has been proven in the lab</a> but is still in its infancy. A look at the graph below from the <a href=""https://phyconomy.net/articles/alaskas-fledgling-seaweed-growers-need-to-lower-costs-to-access-new-markets/"">Alaska Seaweed Market Assessment</a> report shows that 2026 is a reasonable aim for this technology to be commercially ready. </p>

<p>Pending the development of technologies to commercialize seaweed protein extracts and concentrates, alternative protein startups have focused on adding whole seaweed to their products. Trophic, for instance, is about to come to market with <a href=""https://grist.org/fix/this-startup-says-seaweed-is-the-secret-to-a-better-faux-burger-and-a-healthier-climate/"">a bacon replacement made from dulse</a>.</p>

<p>Comfort foods that could benefit from a boost of seaweed’s umami profile are a natural fit and burgers are an obvious starting point for an alt-protein startup. Started in 2013 as a food truck, <a href=""https://dutchweedburger.com/"">The Dutch Weed Burger</a> was the first company to produce a soy-based patty enriched with kombu. The company went from food truck festivals to supermarket shelves and was recently acquired by The LiveKindly Collective with the intent to scale up and expand beyond its national borders. Chilean company <a href=""https://quelp.cl/"">Quelp</a> has a similar burger on offer. </p>

<p>In the US, Akua raised more than $1M for <a href=""https://republic.co/akua"">its kelp burger</a> through crowdfunding. Meanwhile, Trophic, the company working on dulse-based bacon, has created a process for extracting a 65% protein concentrate from red seaweed. <a href=""https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/05/22/Trophic-explores-potential-of-red-seaweed-protein-concentrate-as-multi-functional-ingredient-in-plant-based-meat-seafood"">The company says</a> the non-protein substances can be useful ingredients for meat substitute products by contributing color, flavor, and vitamins. </p>

<p>Other startups currently in the R&amp;D phase are Born Maverick, <a href=""https://www.newsletter.co.uk/business/consumer/ni-based-company-born-maverick-develops-foods-of-the-future-3368766"">developing shrimp and scallop replacements from seaweeds</a>, and <a href=""https://www.plantruption.com/"">Plantruption</a>, also coming out with a seaweed burger. A company that’s instead taking the hybrid route is Umameats. By adding seaweeds to traditional meat products, <a href=""https://umameats.nl/"">Umameats</a> wants to elevate their taste and nutritional profile. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the cell-based space, seaweed is being used by Korean startup <a href=""http://seawith.net/en/"">Seawith</a> as scaffolding for its structured cultivated meat products.</p>

<p><strong>This is just the start</strong></p>

<p>Seaweed is the collective noun for a group of at least 10,000 species of macroalgae, and new ones are being discovered each year. With only half a dozen species cultivated at scale right now, seaweed’s potential for the alt-protein industry is only just starting to unfold. </p>

<p>Agriculture has had a 10,000-year head start on sea farming. It’s time for a little catch-up.</p>

Over the past year, we’ve had the privilege of working closely with one such individual. If you haven’t yet heard of her, you probably soon will.</p>

<p>In July 2020, <em>Protein Report</em> received a message through its website contact form:</p>

<p><em>“Hi! My name is Avery Parkinson, and I’m a 15-year-old student from Ottawa, Canada. Over the past nine months, I’ve been doing a lot of research and writing into cellular agriculture as an alternative protein source, and this summer, I am doing a research internship at Tufts University and New Harvest on insect tissue engineering as a possibility for cultured meat. … As a frequent reader of your content, I was wondering how I could get more involved in the amazing work you do!”</em></p>

<p>A year later, Avery is now the 16-year-old executive director of <a href=""https://www.cellag.ca/"">Cellular Agriculture Canada</a>. She’s also the recipient of a 2021 Diana Award, founder of <a href=""https://asandwichortwo.com/"">A Sandwich or Two</a>, and co-founder of the <a href=""https://maplewishes.org/"">MapleWishes Foundation</a> — not to mention one of <em>Protein Report</em>’s leading contributors. The list of her accomplishments, awards, and examples of selfless dedication to improving our food systems and helping those in need is both humbling and inspiring.</p>

<p>But who is Avery Parkinson, and what goes on in the mind of such a young leader? We decided to ask her.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Give us a brief introduction. Where you’re from, your main professional, educational, and extracurricular activities — basically a summary of what someone would find on your resume.</strong></p>

<p>I’m from Ottawa, Canada, and in my last year of high school. I am very passionate about food production, and so in addition to working with <em>Protein Report</em>, I’m also the executive director of Cellular Agriculture Canada and am collaborating with Just Vertical — a Canadian vertical gardening company — to launch a podcast focusing on the wide range of topics that fall under sustainable food systems. In addition to these activities, I’ve started a project called the National Sandwich Making Initiative, which aims to get schools and youth groups across Canada organizing sessions where students come together to make sandwiches in support of their local homeless populations. Because of this, I’ve had the opportunity to be a part of programs such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Ambassadors and the International Baccalaureate’s Student Innovators. In school, I am this year’s community service prefect and so am involved with our reconciliation coalition, sexuality and gender alliance, anti-racism and allyship club, and I help manage initiatives that support nonprofit organizations operating in our city.</p>

<p><strong>There are so many reasons to be excited about cellular agriculture. Sustainability, animal welfare, more equitable food systems, new kinds of foods and culinary possibilities, and more. How did you first learn about cellular agriculture, and what initially captured your interest?</strong></p>

<p>When I was 13, I was enamored with the idea of vegetarianism, and after a bit of contemplation, I decided to adopt the diet. Initially, I was convinced that if everyone gave up meat in favor of plant-based foods, many of the concerns surrounding modern livestock farming would be rendered inconsequential. But after observing my mostly meat-eating family, I realized that this approach was perhaps a little unreasonable and would be unfair to ask of everyone. Two years later, a friend told me about an article she read discussing Perfect Day’s 1,000-order limited launch of ice cream that incorporated non-animal whey protein. After doing a little more research and realizing that this was an application of cellular agriculture, I was struck by the technology’s potential to produce staples of our modern diet at scale and at reduced expense to the environment, public health, and animal welfare — basically the three concerns I had with conventional meat production. It may be able to ameliorate all of these challenges but still allow consumers to enjoy the foods they’ve always been able to, and that’s what fascinated me.</p>

<p><strong>How has being immersed in the field changed your understanding of it (if at all), and what excites you most about it now?</strong></p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, my understanding and feelings about cellular agriculture have mainly been reaffirmed. Being involved with organizations including New Harvest, the Good Food Institute, Big Idea Ventures, and Cellular Agriculture Australia has exposed me to many different angles from which people are working to advance the technology. This has really highlighted for me how interdisciplinary the subject is and how it not only benefits from but actually requires the expertise of all different professions and skill sets in order to realize its potential. We need the policymakers and regulators, the investors and incubators, the entrepreneurs and researchers, and the science communicators and reporters to make the field thrive. This is what really excites me — that there is no shortage of ways for people to apply their diverse expertise and backgrounds, which only hints at the creative things we might see come out of this field moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>You recently became executive director of Cellular Agriculture Canada. Tell us about how that happened.</strong></p>

<p>Last December, our wonderful executive director, Yadira Tejeda-Saldana, left us to work as research collaborations director at New Harvest. Up until that point, I had been volunteering with Cellular Agriculture Canada by doing communications for conferences and co-authoring a white paper. So in the interim, I served as volunteer coordinator to help manage some of the continuing projects. I really enjoyed taking on that leadership role and thinking of my own ideas for how we might further the field in Canada, and after a few months, it was suggested to me by a couple of people that I apply to become the next executive director.</p>

<p><strong>As you explored in your article, </strong><a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/cellular-agriculture-finds-its-true-north""><strong>Cellular Agriculture Finds Its True North</strong></a><strong>, Canada has a potentially significant role to play in the industry’s development. What do you see as the main challenges and opportunities unique to Canada? And how do you plan to address them in your new role? Any other exciting plans for the organization?</strong></p>

<p>To be honest, when it comes to cellular agriculture, I think that the majority of the challenges Canada has are a combination of challenges we are seeing in other countries. As the technical side of the field becomes even more impressive — the products becoming more accurate analogs for conventional meat and their production more feasible — the importance of having a fair and appropriate regulatory framework for commercial products is becoming more apparent. Additionally, because it is not often clear whether cellular agriculture is considered to be “agriculture” or a “bioscience,” it is more difficult to apply for sources of governmental funding. This is one of the main issues that CAC is trying to tackle. Earlier this year, we convened the first-ever panel of government regulators to discuss how the implementation of a regulatory framework might look and we are in the process of publishing a report summarizing the findings. We are also currently looking for a policy coordinator to join our team and help us work with the regulators to establish and pursue next steps.</p>

<p>Public acceptance of the technology has also been brought up as a potential concern, and of course, I think that there are better ways of going about introducing the technology to the general public. But I am also of the opinion that if cell-based products can offer a similar or better experience to consumers and achieve price parity with conventional protein products, their adoption will follow. As with any emerging technology, different segments of Canadian society will be able to bring different perspectives and will raise different concerns. In order to make sure that the implementation of this technology is as beneficial for all Canadians as possible, CAC is trying to engage different stakeholders in conversation so that we can proactively address these concerns with informed solutions. In particular, our country has a long history of colonization, the legacy of which is still visible today in the way that food insecurity, the climate crisis, and some chronic diseases are disproportionately affecting our multitude of Indigenous communities. In the interest of contributing to the effort to decolonize our food system, we are starting a project to listen to Indigenous perspectives on the technology to discern how it can be realized in such a way as to not intensify, and perhaps counteract, the social issues highlighted by our current food system.</p>

<p><strong>Part of what makes you so remarkable is your age. How does it feel to be such an influential young leader? What unique perspective do you think that might bring to your work, the industry, public awareness, and younger generations?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve never considered myself to be that influential of a leader, but I do appreciate the sentiment! I think that everyone who works in cellular agriculture — and even the alternative protein industry — is a visionary, and I’ve been fortunate to have been able to learn from many remarkable people from many different professional backgrounds who are lending their expertise to the field. I think that as a youth, there is a certain sense of urgency to act on the climate crisis, public health, and other time-sensitive issues as this is the world we inherited and will be passing on. As an individual, I also hope to inspire other young people by example to continuously learn and do what they can to advance their passion. From an outsider’s perspective, cellular agriculture does seem like a very niche field, but it is something I am happy to contribute to every day.</p>

<p><strong>Should cellular agriculture be taking a more forward-looking approach to marketing, like we’ve seen with the Shojinmeat Project in Japan? If so, what might that look like in a Western cultural context?</strong></p>

<p>I am by no means an expert when it comes to marketing, but I do admire the sense of futurism that the Shojinmeat Project is able to evoke through its marketing and how it is able to align with styles of graphics that are prevalent in Japanese pop culture (at least from my understanding). I think because Canada has such a diverse range of consumers, in particular a significant conservative demographic, we would need to be a bit wary of making their initial brush with the technology too futuristic in terms of the way it’s presented. For other consumers, this strategy may be incredibly effective — it’s about finding that balance in order to provide a unified face for the technology, especially at first. But in all honesty, this is a topic about which I know very little, so I would be very interested to hear other perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>You’re running Cellular Agriculture Canada, managing your own charity and nonprofit organization, working a summer job, and working with <em>Protein Report</em> — and you’re still in high school. How do you manage everything? Do you sleep?</strong></p>

<p>I think like most students, time management is always a work in progress. That being said, when you enjoy the things you’re working on, it is that much more exciting to commit your time to them. One thing I have learned over the past few years is to never be afraid to ask for help. It’s impossible to achieve all the things you want to complete by yourself, and more often than not, collaborating with someone else with complementary expertise will make you more successful. For this reason, I am so grateful for our amazing team of volunteers and board members at Cellular Agriculture Canada and the other organizations with which I am affiliated.</p>

<p><strong>At 16 you’ve already launched an impressive career. Any ideas about what directions you might go in the future, academically or professionally?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, it’s a bit of a debate between bioengineering and medicine. Regardless of what I end up doing, I would want it to have implications for systems change beyond the actual tasks at hand. With respect to bioengineering, I would hope to work in the cultivated meat space, or at least the alternative protein industry in general. This might end up looking like working at a startup or in research, but most likely some combination of the two. Medicine was a relatively recent consideration after I spent the summer working at a group home for developmentally challenged adults. If I do pursue that route, I would like to couple my practice with policymaking in order to ensure that currently underserved segments of Canadian society are able to have access to competent and equitable healthcare.</p>

<p><strong>Besides nerding out about food and cellular agriculture, what else do you enjoy? Do any particular arts or other activities especially inspire you?</strong></p>

<p>For sure! For about 10 years now I have been learning and performing a style of classical Indian dance called Odissi. Since I was in elementary school, I have also been writing competitive math contests. I’m also an avid reader, and my favorite authors at the moment are Zadie Smith and Viet Thanh Nguyen.

<hr />
<p>A growing number of entrepreneurs challenge the assumption that meat eating will expand as industrializing countries amass wealth and seek protein-rich diets. Most attention has been on the innovators producing protein-rich alternatives, particularly plant-based and cell-based options. Sales of <a href=""https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/04/06/How-is-coronavirus-impacting-plant-based-meat-Impossible-Foods-weighs-in"">plant-based proteins</a>, for example, totaled $5 billion in 2019 and climbed 158 percent in 2020. Financial firm UBS predicts that the U.S. market will grow to $85 billion by 2030, and <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346116#:~:text=Plant-based%20Meat%20Has%20Officially%20Reached%20%27Global%20Phenomenon%27%20Status,and%20eating.%20Image%20credit%3A%20milan2099%20%7C%20Getty%20Images""><em>Entrepreneur</em></a> magazine suggests that plant-based meat “has officially reached ‘global phenomenon’ status.”</p>

<p>Less recognized are the innovators developing serums and mixes in which cell- and plant-based proteins can grow. Some of the most creative are using ancient and simple components—including algae and mycelia—to create the foundations for animal protein alternatives.</p>

<p>Algae, the planet’s original singled-celled living organism, already undergirds cosmetic creams, flavorings, colorants, ice creams, and vitamin supplements—which have become a $5-billion industry. Leonard Lerer, founder and CEO of Back of the Yards Algae Sciences, envisions a significantly larger market for algae with meat alternatives.</p>

<p>Taking a jab at the Western diet’s dependence on cattle and pork, Lerer named his firm after the Union Stock Yards once located in southern Chicago and featured in Upton Sinclair’s <em>The Jungle</em>. Back of the Yards Algae Sciences, in fact, is one of several food-based start-ups located within a 100,000 square-foot former meatpacking facility. “The meat of hundreds of millions of pigs was probably processed in here,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/climate/circular-food-economy-sustainable.html"">explains Lerer</a>. “And soon we will be able to make a burger that is 100 percent algae-based and cruelty-free.” According to the CEO, the building has gone full circle as a center for food innovation, starting early in the 20th century when it launched canning, cold storage, and industrialized meat production. Today, while it maintains the smoke-stained bricks from its former pork production, the structure serves as a laboratory for alternative proteins, while large-scale production of algae/mycelia-based colorants, feed, and food is done at a facility in Utah.</p>

<p>Algae, which Lerer calls “the source of life,” enjoy numerous attributes. They grow ten times faster than soybeans, and they need a tenth of the land to produce the same amount of plant material. They thrive virtually anywhere, including non-productive and non-arable lands, with multiple yields throughout the year, and they do not compete with other crops for soil. They produce no waste materials. Pound for pound, they contain twice the protein of meat, more beta-carotene than carrots, more iron than spinach, and substantial amounts of omega-3 acids. Farming algae does not cause erosion or require synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. The organisms do not even demand fresh water, with the protists being quite happy in brackish, sea, or wastewater.</p>

<p>Algae help solve several of our greatest population and environmental challenges. Rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins, they fortify food and combat malnutrition among a growing population. Lerer increasingly mixes algae with mycelia, the thread-like filaments from mushrooms and other fungi. He admits that algae-as-a-feedstock has been hyped previously but suffered two setbacks during the second half of the twentieth century. In the 1950s, researchers touted <em>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</em> as a solution to global malnutrition, with the United Nations suggesting it was “the most ideal food for mankind” and the Food and Agriculture Organization calling it “the best food for tomorrow.” Yet <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/3106856"">no one mastered</a> making <em>Chlorella</em> economically on a large scale. During the first oil crisis in the early 1970s, investors tried to convert algae into a biofuel that would replace gasoline, but, again, the process proved to be too expensive.</p>

<p>Lerer, however, argues algal science has progressed substantially and the combination of global warming and population growth creates a new imperative. He believes the biggest potential is not in the best-known algae, such as seaweeds and spirulina, the dried blue-green organism that is a common dietary supplement and food additive. More promising is growing algae as the bedrock of sustainable, plant-based and cell-based food industries that produce protein-rich alternatives to meat.</p>

<p>Lerer uses his biodigester’s mixture to develop a serum in which cultured meats grow. “We want to work towards a future where a leftover piece of food could turn into the meat we would eat tomorrow,” one of Lerer’s colleagues explains. “This is why we are focused on developing an <a href=""https://agfundernews.com/afn-introduces-singene-and-back-of-the-yards-algae-sciences.html"">algal stimulant to help cell-based products</a> grow faster, get more yield, better shelf life, and flavor.” Lerer also develops algae-based heme that could serve as the foundation for plant-based meat substitutes, such as those produced by Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat.</p>

<p>Lerer’s latest targets are vertical farms, those indoor plant factories that optimize environmental conditions, nutrition, and lighting. Such sophisticated greenhouses allow food to be grown locally, reducing the need for transcontinental shipping, and limiting the use of chemical pesticides. After two years of research, Lerer discovered how to create an extract from a blue-green algae—specifically the protein-pigment complex, known as phycocyanin, that regulates photosynthesis in the algae—to stimulate the produce’s growth, yield, and quality. The <a href=""https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202011.0354/v1"">bio-stimulant</a> reduced maturation times by 21 percent, produced 12.5 percent more protein-rich produce, and postponed wilting by several days. According to Lerer, the algae extract “gives vertical farmers a new avenue for reducing costs, while improving produce’s color, vigor, nutrient content, and preservation.”</p>

<p>Algae refer to a broad collection of organisms, perhaps more than one-million varieties, of which only 60,000 have been studied and just 20 used in modern food chains. “There’s so much untapped potential,” says Lerer. Depending on what he’s trying to produce—such as cultured-meat serum or heme for plant-based meats—the entrepreneur uses microscopy and metabolite analysis to select the most appropriate algal and mycelia strains, and he breeds different eukaryotic organisms to optimize his outputs.</p>

<p>Lerer admits meat consumption could soar, as evidenced by the average Chinese consumer increasing <a href=""https://www.economist.com/international/2019/05/04/global-meat-eating-is-on-the-rise-bringing-surprising-benefits"">meat intake</a> from nine pounds in 1961 to 137 pounds in 2013, with larger boosts occurring in Thailand, Brazil, and Morocco. Yet he believes alternatives will accelerate—thereby improving animal welfare, environmental quality, and health—but only if plant- and cell-based producers obtain better blends in which to grow their proteins. Fortunately, modern scientists are repositioning basic organisms to help meat substitutes thrive.</p>

But this is just part of the technology’s history. There’s a largely unheard story unfolding in Japan that shows a whole other realm of possibility for how an industry can be born — one in which citizen scientists grow meat at home, come together as a community, and ultimately play a key role in policy-making processes that unlock public funding, generate consumer awareness, and open the door for product launches. This movement is called the Shojinmeat Project and its founder is Yuki Hanyu.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>In the past, there have been cases of scientists and entrepreneurs inspired by popular works of science fiction starting a venture to bring those futuristic visions into reality. In retrospect, I was one of them, with my sources of inspiration being anime, manga, and video games. The futures portrayed in these works, though — with things grown in fluorescent-green culture vats — ranged from dystopian to utopian. Obviously, I wanted the utopian version, so I began the <a href=""https://shojinmeat.com/wordpress/en/"">Shojinmeat Project</a> in February 2014 as an optimistic experiment.</p>

<p>Because of its promise as a technology that may eventually touch the life of every person on the planet, I knew there was a different way to generate public interest and further research in cellular agriculture. Rather than follow the standard path for tech innovation, I wanted to see what would happen if we started with affordable, accessible resources and an open-source approach to the technology’s development. How far could our collective creativity take us?</p>

<p>The Shojinmeat Project is a Japanese nonprofit serving a global community of citizen scientists interested in cellular agriculture. There is no formal definition of membership and the group is open to anyone wanting to get into this field, whether through DIY cell culture, artistic activities, hosting academic conferences, or simply sharing information and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Since its founding, we have involved countless young citizen scientists and served as a pipeline for those talents to move into policy and advisory roles within the Japanese government and private sector. Our meetings have also been a starting point for a number of public- and private-sector spin offs to form and come together, making significant contributions toward a uniquely open and inclusive cellular agriculture industry in Japan.</p>

<p>But while I have previously been interviewed about some specific developments, only those who were there from the beginning saw the whole journey — and so I’d like to share here the story of some of the Shojinmeat Project’s key milestones and how our little experiment came to have a big impact on national policy.</p>

<p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p>

<p>The Shojinmeat Project was born from a casual gathering of students and graduates at an informal coworking space in Tokyo. When I pitched the idea of cell-cultured meat, Dr. Ikko, a life-science post-doc who would later become the CTO of IntegriCulture, responded with the idea of large-scale cell-culture based on commodity food materials and conditioned medium. Since the concept was testable through DIY bio outside traditional laboratory environments, we set out to explore its feasibility.</p>

<p>Growing the nascent Shojinmeat Project community was another matter. We needed a hook that represented our geocultural context and unique vision, while appealing to young people who tend to be more open to new ideas. Avoiding elitism, hubris, and ensuring transparency were key priorities to prevent distrust (like we had seen around GMOs) of this new food technology.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we knew environmental sustainability would not be sufficiently compelling as it lacked entertainment value. Similarly, an animal-welfare focus was too foreign and polarizing. In contrast, however, sci-fi anime, manga, and literature had already made references to cell-cultured meat in their visions of the future. And admittedly, I was (and still am) heavily immersed in “otaku” fandom — the Japanese term often used to describe young people with an obsessive interest in subjects such as computers, video games, anime, and manga.</p>

<p>We started by posting our DIY cell-culture procedure on Niconico, the most popular video-sharing platform among otaku in Japan, including an actual tasting of DIY homegrown meat. What was shown in the video was also converted into a fanzine to be sold at Comiket, an event similar to ComicCon in the US. These approaches were both entertaining and effective at showcasing our radically transparent approach to the cell-culturing process, while eliminating any elements of elitism from the subject.</p>

<p>There was definitely a young, playful counterculture spirit, among the members we attracted through these activities and a lot of our motivation was driven by a sort of rebellious, ironic humor: A high-school student growing meat at home ahead of universities or corporations? We actually did that, and it was televised nationwide in 2017. Shortly after the televised event, IntegriCulture — which was registered in 2015 as a vehicle to gain access to lab equipment for the Shojinmeat Project — spun off to go on its own startup journey.</p>

<p>While forging this unique path, we were also monitoring developments overseas. As early as 2015, Shojinmeat Project members were in contact with both New Harvest and the newly created Good Food Institute, sharing our approach and incorporating their work into ours. It was around this time that much of the sector’s terminology was beginning to develop — the term “cellular agriculture” was <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/lost-history-naming-cellular-agriculture/"">coined in New Harvest’s Facebook group</a>, and having seen this development, a Shojinmeat Project member coined the Japanese term and created its Japanese-language <a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%B0%E8%83%9E%E8%BE%B2%E6%A5%AD"">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>At a 2016 conference organized by Dr. Mark Post, the Maastricht University scientist who created the first cell-cultured hamburger in 2013, I made a presentation on DIY cultured meat, introducing attendees to the Shojinmeat Project, our citizen-science mission, and our unique positioning, backed neither by a corporation nor a university. Our goal was two-fold: we wanted to raise awareness about cellular agriculture as well as to nurture a working model in which anyone was empowered to contribute to the technology’s development.</p>

<p>Later, aided by an offer of help from a South African supporter, we launched an open-access <a href=""https://shojinmeatenglish.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzExMTIzMjM5MjUyLWZhYmM2OGNkYzdmMmFhMWJkY2NlZTlkNDU1ZTAyZDFiY2Q2ODM1ZTllMjI1MzBlYjJiYjdmMjEwNDdkYjA1NDg#/shared-invite/email"">English-language Slack channel</a> to connect people from around the world who were interested in cellular agriculture. The connection with New Harvest also <a href=""https://thespoon.tech/shojinmeat-scores-grant-for-open-source-clean-meat-initiative/"">led to funding</a> from the Shuttleworth Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports those working on innovative solutions to social problems.</p>

<p>After starting small and developing our hobbyist community over several years, our work finally began to attract greater attention.</p>

<p><strong>JST-Mirai Program</strong></p>

<p>In the fall of 2017, a number of officials from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) came to one of the Shojinmeat Project’s weekly meetings held at the <a href=""https://fabcafe.com/jp/tokyo/"">FabCafe</a> in Tokyo. One of those representatives was considering cultured meat as the subject of their next open call for “future society creation projects” (JST-Mirai), a class of JST-supported projects aimed at encouraging Japanese innovation and environmental sustainability. Buoyed by the initiative on display and the ideas being presented — including chats about DIY home kitchen experimentation and live seed cell sharing — JST officials saw promise in our work, and in cellular agriculture as a whole. At that time, Shojinmeat Project was the only source of information on cellular agriculture from perspectives specifically relevant to Japan.</p>

<p>It was also during this period — as our first cohort of high school students had become energized by their DIY meat-growing experiments — that the Shojinmeat Project began reaching new audiences. We had created an anime-inspired <a href=""https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31104033"">video of a DIY cultured-meat bun</a> for a presentation at the Niconico Chokaigi Convention (similar to Los Angeles’ Anime Expo), challenging anyone interested to make the same thing, and we were overwhelmed by the enthusiastic response.</p>

<p>A few months later, in May of 2018 and after several rounds of further meetings and email exchanges between JST officials and Shojinmeat Project members, the <a href=""https://www.jst.go.jp/mirai/en/program/sustainable/JPMJMI20C1.html"">JST-Mirai Program</a> was launched. This was an ambitious program that allocated $20 million over five years to a team of academic labs and industry players, with the goal of developing a one-centimeter-thick steak using a culture medium made from microalgae. The scale and scope were years ahead of other countries’ projects. It was the first time so much public funding had been earmarked for cultured meat research and the intention behind this generous funding was for both companies and universities to put it to practical and innovative use. In early project milestones, <a href=""https://www.nissin.com/en_jp/sustainability/feature/cultured-meat/"">Nissin Foods</a> revealed a <a href=""https://soranews24.com/2019/03/24/cup-noodle-makers-successfully-create-lab-grown-diced-steak-with-authentic-texture/"">cube of cultured meat</a> in 2019, while Tokyo Women’s Medical University published <a href=""https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/btpr.2941"">exciting research</a> into microalgae hydrolysate basal medium.</p>

<p>Although we can’t claim responsibility for the launch of the JST-Mirai Program, there were clear synchronicities between its timing, focus, and our meetings and exchanges with those JST officials. This was hugely encouraging and a sign of even greater things to come.</p>

<p><strong>MAFF Food Tech Study Group</strong></p>

<p>Around the same time as the launch of the JST-Mirai program, some significant developments were also brewing inside Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).</p>

<p>In 2018, a group of energetic young MAFF officials formed around a mutual frustration with the ministry’s largely “reactive” approach to policy making. This group — called Team 414 — instead wanted to see MAFF leading innovation on farming, food, and sustainability issues rather than merely responding to challenges as they emerge — and the Shojinmeat Project caught their attention.</p>

<p>Team 414 began by <a href=""https://business.nikkei.com/atcl/report/15/252376/050900143/"">publishing documents</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OpenLabwithMAFF/posts/1633554220076283/"">urging the government</a> to leverage emerging food technologies and take a more forward-looking approach. Throughout that year, they also organized several meetings that brought together key stakeholders to explore possible strategies. Shojinmeat Project members enthusiastically participated in those meetings, and, looking back at <a href=""https://agri.mynavi.jp/2018_10_26_45353/"">photos from that time</a>, I can see one of our members with a copy of the Pure Meat Book — the self-published zine containing a DIY cell-culture manual made for the Comiket convention.</p>

<p>At these forums, speakers from Team 414 discussed emerging food technologies, alternative protein, and the burgeoning culture and global interest that was developing around cellular agriculture. Based on these exchanges, they submitted an internal policy advisory in April 2019 aimed at promoting cell-cultured meat and cellular agriculture innovation within MAFF.</p>

<p>The advisory’s goal was to create a better Japanese model for the development of cell-cultured meat, one in which the industry’s potential and opportunities would not be concentrated among a few, but instead openly shared with livestock farmers and other traditional agricultural interests. In order to ensure a sustainable future for cellular agriculture in Japan, they reasoned, the industry would need to take a less confrontational and more inclusive approach from the beginning, thus avoiding the tensions between its proponents and the traditional livestock industry advocates, as has been seen in the US and other countries. According to the officials from Team 414, much of the material on cellular agriculture in their policy advisory, including a potential model for integrating traditional farmers, was borrowed from the Shojinmeat Project’s <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/2co/2019-127817694"">open-access slides</a>.</p>

<p>Though some members of Team 414 were concerned that older MAFF officials might not grasp the importance of the proposal, the fact it was submitted was nevertheless an important milestone — and it didn’t go unnoticed within MAFF.</p>

<p>In April 2020, MAFF established the “Food Tech Study Group” with members of Team 414 at its core. This was a collaborative, multidisciplinary, open forum intended to gather perspectives from food companies, research institutes, government agencies, and venture capital firms. There were no restrictions on who could participate and this was important to us because the key value of this study group was in getting everyone — including stakeholders from the world of conventional agriculture — on board, so that we could establish inclusive policies that respected all participants of all sectors.</p>

<p>Many members of the Shojinmeat Project joined this forum, and several were instrumental in leading its cell-ag discussions — one (who later became the GFI-APAC Japan delegate) introduced overseas regulatory systems, another posited how Muslims may view cell-cultured meat, while others led discussions on public communications and key technical hurdles. Additionally, many of the questions and topics that arose at these meetings were based on information from the Shojinmeat Project’s <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/2co/shojinmeat-project-open-source-cellular-agriculture-initiative-2021"">slideshow</a> which had previously been shared with the group’s participants.</p>

<p>One of the study group’s key outputs was a Japanese-language <a href=""https://www.maff.go.jp/j/kanbo/foodtech/foodtech_kenkyukai_torimatome.pdf"">interim report</a> on strategies to leverage emerging food technologies that would contribute toward a more sustainable food economy and better Japanese food security. The study group was later reorganized into the “Food Tech Government Council” — exclusively for exploring and coordinating public sector collaboration — and the “<a href=""https://www.gov-base.info/en/2020/09/25/127328"">Food Tech Public-Private Council</a>” which is held privately in order to allow for the sharing of trade secrets and other sensitive information among its participants. As part of its regular monitoring of government and industry activity, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service also <a href=""https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Japan%20Begins%20to%20Explore%20Regulations%20for%20Alternative%20Meat%20Products_Tokyo_Japan_08-12-2020"">reported</a> on these developments.</p>

<p>In this way, our vision of a cell-ag revolution with no one left behind had begun to take shape within the government.</p>

<p>Technology is a double-edged sword and promoting innovation alone isn’t enough to ensure we actually reap its benefits. Instead, nonprofits like New Harvest and Shojinmeat Project advocate for how a cell-ag future <em>should</em> look by thinking several steps beyond simple feasibility.</p>

<p>This approach is also closely related to the concept of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking"">rulemaking</a>. Rulemaking differs significantly from lobbying: While lobbyists may work on behalf of special interests or specific industries to achieve policy or regulatory goals, rulemaking takes a broader, more inclusive approach — one that concerns how things should be from a multi-stakeholder perspective, balancing interests from government, industry, academia, and nonprofits, to stage a society-wide harmonization process.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy but underreported aspect of the Shojinmeat Project’s work has been its impact on rulemaking for cellular agriculture in Japan.</p>

<p>Thanks to Team 414 and the JST-Mirai Program, the momentum surrounding rulemaking for cellular agriculture was beginning to form inside the government, but we were still missing a nonprofit thinktank dedicated to cellular agriculture. Cellular Agriculture Institute of the Commons (CAIC) spun out from the Shojinmeat Project to fill this role. With this new entity, we now had sufficient private-sector, nonprofit, and government involvement to launch a formal rulemaking process aimed at creating and implementing cellular agriculture policies.</p>

<p>The Tama University Center for Rulemaking Strategies (CRS) is a think tank that brings together public, private, academic, and nonprofit-sector stakeholders to both formulate and implement new policies. After being contacted by a Shojinmeat Project member, CRS began organizing roundtable discussions on cellular agriculture. This <a href=""https://crs-japan.org/en/programs/cellular-agriculture/"">multi-stakeholder roundtable</a> became the Japan Association for Cellular Agriculture (JACA), and the Shojinmeat Project think-tank spinout — CAIC — was appointed to lead those discussions as its secretariat.</p>

<p>This formalization of the rulemaking process connects back to the Food Tech Study Group in which MAFF’s Team 414 was so instrumental. That group had since split into several subgroups to focus on specific topics such as plant-based proteins, insect-based proteins, space food, research funding, and cellular agriculture, among others. In September of 2020, JACA formally inherited the cellular agriculture subgroup, thereby becoming the official rulemaking body for cellular agriculture in Japan.</p>

<p>The upcoming agenda for JACA includes the assembly of a comprehensive policy recommendation, formation of a <a href=""http://www.fao.org/policy-support/policy-themes/parliamentary-alliances/en/"">parliamentary alliance</a> for cellular agriculture, and submission of the policy recommendation to government agencies and other policy makers under the auspices of the parliamentary alliance. These recommendations will cover broad topics to synchronize developments across a range of sectors, including food safety regulations, IP handling of starter cells, allocating of power and responsibility among agencies, recommendations on trade union scopes and policies, focus areas for academic studies, and recommended schemes for grants and subsidies.</p>

<p>So far, these developments have not attracted much media attention. But JACA has been steadily growing and attracting key international players such as GFI-APAC, BlueNalu, MosaMeat, Aleph Farms, and other global stakeholders, all of whom have taken part in its discussions. In this way, our citizen-science experiment has already borne more fruit than I ever could have expected. Our inclusive, no-one-left-behind vision for cellular agriculture can now be seen in Japan’s national policy, with a public-inclusive approach having become the default working model. We hope this will serve as inspiration for others aiming to achieve similar objectives.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the Shojinmeat Project’s goal is to continue working to ensure cellular agriculture develops as a technology with accessible entry points for ordinary citizens and anyone else wanting to get involved — not just for corporations, elite investors, or other profit-seeking interests. How things should be is achievable, but only if we embrace and continuously work toward a truly open and inclusive development path for this new industry.</p>

My research aims to figure out how we can start this supply chain off on the right foot.”","<p>“The thing about the cellular agriculture supply chain is that there isn’t one,” says Dalhousie University Ph.D. candidate, Dawne Skinner. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Skinner is a New Harvest Research Fellow whose <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/people/?direct-link=60c372803e839"">research focuses on</a> identifying opportunities for the cellular agriculture industry to apply circular economy interventions to its processes.</p>
<p>This economic sustainability paradigm, also sometimes referred to as a closed-loop system, is focused on designing waste out of the economy, keeping materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. According to the <a href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept"">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>, decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources can improve the triple bottom line — the social, environmental, and financial outcomes of our economic system.</p>
<p>“Many other industries use a linear model — take, make, use, and dispose — which is clearly unsustainable. Once a supply chain is established,” says Skinner, “it is essentially locked in because it is too costly to reconfigure. Given that the cell-based industry is nascent, we are in the stage of initiating a new supply chain. My research aims to figure out how we can start this supply chain off on the right foot.”</p>
<p>Skinner’s work is particularly noteworthy because, as an environmental engineer and consultant who recently completed an MBA in Innovation, Enterprise, and the Circular Economy, she brings a fresh perspective to a field dominated by those with a biotech background.</p>
<p>That industry focus on biotech isn’t surprising given that the majority of cellular agriculture research and development (R&amp;D) leverages the pharmaceutical supply chain. “Pharmaceutical-grade applications have higher purities than food-grade applications, which incurs many additional costs in the production of cell-based products,” says Skinner. “This could be overcome, in part, with a more appropriate approach to inputs and outputs.”</p>
<p>In other words, where any opportunities exist to produce culture media from non-pharmaceutical-grade inputs, the industry can, in theory, <a href=""https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-cell-culture-medium-costs/"">dramatically drive down</a> not only the R&amp;D costs but those passed along to the consumer as well, making the future of cellular agriculture much more viable. And while proponents of cell ag suggest that the technology has the potential to eliminate many of the adverse environmental outcomes associated with conventional animal production, preliminary life-cycle analyses <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26383898/"">suggest</a> that the technology isn't inherently superior across all sustainability metrics — due to its higher energy, wastewater processing, and feedstock requirements.</p>
<p>As Skinner noted in her New Harvest application, though, the purpose of her project “is to identify opportunities for this budding sector to leverage the potential triple-bottom-line benefits of closed-loop/circular economy production systems and supply chains [...] to gain competitive advantage, improve sustainability, and to model/optimize such a system.” In innovation, there’s hope. A <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306095192_Closing_loops_in_agricultural_supply_chains_using_multi-objective_optimization_A_case_study_of_an_industrial_mushroom_supply_chain"">2017 study</a>, for instance, suggests that adopting a closed-loop supply chain in agricultural production resulted in an 11% increase in profitability and a 28% improvement in environmental outcomes.</p>
<p>Skinner’s research, very much in line with these goals, will take the form of a case study. “We first need to build a model based on existing knowledge and processes. Once we get the model built and validated, we will be looking for data from companies who are working on the same product to run through the model and record how much of an improvement there is. We have not yet reached out to companies, but we are hoping to get ones who are at the stage where they are thinking about building their facilities and processes so we can help maximize potential.”</p>
<p>Skinner’s background is in industrial and environmental engineering and, as the owner of Net Positive Solutions Consulting, which is focused on empowering mission-driven and non-profit organizations, she was looking for opportunities to combine engineering with sustainability. “My passion lies in animal welfare, and when I heard about cellular agriculture, I thought about how I could apply my skills to advance the field. Meat production comes with a host of environmental, social, and ethical dilemmas, and I aligned with cell ag’s principle of changing the means of production rather than the product itself.”</p>
<p>This approach parallels the circular economy’s macro-level emphasis on systems change, rather than homing in on incremental fixes or relying on individual austerity. “We’ve been beating consumers over the head with the concept of sustainability for the past 25 years or so, and we are actually worse off. If we can make systemic adjustments, rather than demanding change of individuals, that is less sacrifice on the part of the consumer and thus longer-lasting change.”</p>
<p>For too long, sustainability has been framed as binary in opposition to convenience or as a liability to economic interests — but within a functioning circular economy, Skinner emphasizes that these realities can coexist. “The key is shifting away from something that is unsustainable while at the same time improving the economy’s triple bottom line. This could enable developing countries to leapfrog into a less environmentally intensive future and help developed countries to provide new opportunities to companies. Whenever systems change, there is opportunity to include people that have previously been underrepresented.”</p>",9467,"Circular economy infographic from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Dawne Skinner, New Harvest Research Fellow",

Given the significant implications that new regulations and guidance can have for the alternative protein industry, it is important to ensure that the end results are inclusive and comprehensive.","<p>Over the past few years, the food industry has undergone a revolution, as alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products flood an eager marketplace. Advances in alternative protein technologies — driven by consumer demand for healthier, more sustainable food sources and products — have brought the once-niche category into the mainstream. Though opportunity in this space is abundant, government regulators have not yet caught up to the pace of new product innovation. The ability of companies to market these cutting-edge products has been tempered for a number of reasons by the current regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Consider the issue of sustainability claims. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulatory body responsible for establishing guidelines for environmental claims through its<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf""> </a>""<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf"">Green Guides</a>."" They recently <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/02/2021-13724/regulatory-review-schedule"">announced</a> that it will start reviewing and updating these guides in 2022. At the conclusion of the last review process ten years ago, the FTC chose not to define “sustainable” despite pressure from some sectors to do so. At that time, they determined that there was no consensus among consumers about the meaning of the term, thus preventing the commission from developing and articulating appropriate guidance. In the intervening years, however, the buzz around sustainability claims has only grown louder. Given this new reality, it’s possible the FTC may determine that a single meaning exists, even if specific to particular product categories — allowing them to define it for regulatory purposes going forward.</p>
<p>To the extent that the FTC decides to develop definitions and guidance around sustainable claims in the upcoming review, alternative protein companies will need to be ready for that discussion.</p>
<p>Start pulling together available data on this topic now and exploring the necessity for additional study or analysis. Be ready to respond to challenges that threaten to reduce access to such a claim. Alternative protein marketers stand to be significantly impacted by the outcome of this next review period, and should be prepared to take an active role in its process.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the process of updating its “<a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.65"">healthy</a>” claim regulation under the ongoing Nutrition Innovation Strategy, and is also considering the adoption of a “healthy” symbol for product labels. In requesting comments from stakeholders in 2016 and 2017 on this topic, the FDA not only sought input on nutrient criteria but whether the claim should be available for fortified products and what types of foods should have access to such claims. The FDA signaled it may issue a proposed rule to update “healthy” as soon as this September.  <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Given the significant implications that new regulations and guidance can have for the alternative protein industry, it is important to ensure that the end results are inclusive and comprehensive. Ambiguity on accessibility to these claims for alternative protein products not only puts companies at heightened risk of regulatory enforcement but also increases exposure to class-action lawsuits if claims are deemed inconsistent with requirements. Moreover, public blowback in the event of such a negative outcome could impact the reputation of the entire industry.</p>
<p>Going forward, it is imperative that the alternative protein industry is a part of these regulatory discussions. Companies in this space need to advocate for access to claims that provide a reasonable understanding of how these new products support the health of consumers and the environment. Opportunities for such advocacy will occur in the near future at the regulatory level, and I encourage industry stakeholders to be active participants in the process.</p>

<p><em>Well, certainly, in 10 years many things will evolve; technology will change … But I would always encourage people, when they think about ten years, to ask the question, what won’t change? — Jeff Bezos</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the last ten years, the average American has witnessed sweeping changes at the supermarket. What began as a handful of brands offering soy-based hamburger patties and a few pricey dairy alternatives to a niche customer has become a multi-billion-dollar consumer sector.</p>

<p>But alternative proteins are at an interesting crossroads; despite their growing popularity in the United States, those in the developing world — where populations are growing most rapidly — still hunger for the real thing.</p>

<p>So when one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history advises us to consider what <em>won’t</em> be different ten years from now, a strong global demand for meat is a reliable answer.</p>

<p>We know this because the data backs it up: In virtually every culture, as wealth increases, so too does animal protein consumption.</p>

<p>Meat demand will continue to grow as the population increases, and the world can’t produce enough meat through conventional animal farming alone.<strong> </strong>This is as succinct and persuasive an argument as can be made for investing in cultivated meat and alternative protein.</p>

<p><strong>Investment Overview</strong></p>

<p>Investing in this sector has been incredibly lucrative for those who got in early. For instance, those who saw the potential of Beyond Meat rode that wave to one of the <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meat-soars-163-in-biggest-popping-us-ipo-since-2000-2019-05-02"">most successful IPOs in the last decade</a>, and the company is currently valued at $9 billion.</p>

<p>It’s a staggering figure but it’s important to note that plant-based protein companies are still nibbling at the edge of meat — the consumption of which is both a massive sustainability dilemma <em>and</em> a $1.7-trillion-dollar market that continues to grow.</p>

<p>Alternative protein, despite the notable successes of Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and a handful of others companies, is still in its infancy. That means that there’s still plenty of opportunity for investors interested in this steadily growing sector. But for those investors drawn to cutting-edge technology, cultivated meat may be an even more attractive prospect.</p>

<p>Rarely do retail investors have the opportunity to gain exposure and access to a new technology this early. That’s partly because Agronomics — which bills itself as “a thematic investment play into the clean meat sector” — is one of the only publicly traded options available to those who see the potential in cultivated meat. By offering investors a deep portfolio of companies engaged in the work of getting cultivated meat to market, the risk to the individual of backing a company whose tech doesn’t pan out is somewhat mitigated.</p>

<p><strong>The Potential of Cultivated Meat Technology</strong></p>

<p>While consumers have become savvier over the last ten years about alternative proteins — as well as seeking out more responsibly sourced and humane conventional meat products — cultivated meat offers several distinct advantages investors should consider.</p>

<p>No other protein source asks for so little change in consumer preference. The product is still animal meat. Other alt-proteins require consumers to adapt to a product that is “similar” to meat — whereas cultivated meat represents the potential for rapid mass adoption.</p>

<p>The first forays into cultivated meat date back to 2013 when Mark Post received funding from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/05/google-sergey-brin-synthetic-beef-hamburger"">Sergey Brin</a> and other investors to create the world’s first cultivated burger, which cost approximately $300,000 to produce. Post went on to co-found Mosa Meat, which is in the Agronomics portfolio.</p>

<p>Creating cultivated meat has been described as a process similar to fermenting beer, however, there are significant differences. At a basic level, cultivated meat is grown from animal cells in a bioreactor using growth media. The cells may leverage a scaffolding material to form a “structured” meat like steak or a chicken breast — or “unstructured,” as with ground beef.</p>

<p>While this technology as applied to the creation of cultivated meat may be novel, its roots are in biomedical engineering, where similar techniques have long been used. The result is “real” meat, unlike the plant-based proteins currently offered by Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods. However, after the initial biopsy to obtain starter cells, animals are completely removed from the process — a critical step toward addressing climate change and <a href=""https://www.unep.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and"">preventing future pandemics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Market Projections</strong></p>

<p>A recent <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/5d7fe0e83d119516bfc0017e/1568661791363/RethinkX+Food+and+Agriculture+Report.pdf"">RethinkX report</a> forecast alternative proteins from cultivated meat, plant-based products, and fermentation to completely disrupt animal agriculture. The report’s authors concluded that “by 2035, demand for cow products will have shrunk by 80% to 90%. Other livestock markets such as chicken, pig, and fish will follow a similar trajectory.”</p>

<p>Although slightly less bullish in its forecast, a <a href=""https://www.kearney.com/documents/20152/2795757/How+Will+Cultured+Meat+and+Meat+Alternatives+Disrupt+the+Agricultural+and+Food+Industry.pdf/06ec385b-63a1-71d2-c081-51c07ab88ad1"">2019 analysis</a> conducted by global consultancy AT Kearney offers additional information which should be of particular interest to investors: Researchers there estimate that, by 2040, 60% of meat will come from plant-based or cultivated meat. Even under more conservative scenarios, the industry stands to grow tremendously as consumers continue to make the switch away from animal-based products.</p>

<p>Cultivated meat made its debut in December of 2020, when Eat Just’s cultivated chicken nuggets went to market in Singapore. Additionally, cellular aquaculture company BlueNalu has stated they plan to launch a cultivated seafood product in the US this year, while Upside Foods (formerly known as Memphis Meats) and several other startups will likely bring products to market within the next 18 months. News items like these are educating the consumer base about new products, as well as priming public consciousness for near-term developments.</p>

<p><strong>Investment Opportunity Overview </strong></p>

<p>Agronomics (LSE: ANIC) is listed on the London Stock Exchange and currently has a market cap of $280 million. The company was founded in 2011 as Port Erin Biopharma and was focused on biotech. In 2019, it transitioned to a focus on alternative proteins and was renamed Agronomics.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Agronomics is one of a handful of vehicles that offers retail investors exposure to the cultivated meat industry. Others include Meat-Tech 3D (NASDAQ: MITC), an Israeli cultivated meat company, and Eat Beyond Global (CSE: EATS), a Canadian fund.</p>

<p>VCs and accredited investors typically get the first opportunity when investing in private companies that are leveraging cutting-edge technology — but they also take on the inherent risks. Agronomics represents a unique opportunity to invest in potentially disruptive startups before their IPO or acquisition by publicly traded companies.</p>

<p>Agronomics was the cultivated meat industry’s most active investor in 2020, according to the Good Food Institute’s <a href=""https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/COR-SOTIR-Cultivated-Meat-2021-0429.pdf"">2020 State of the Industry Report</a>. Their investments that year included BlueNalu, Meatable, CellX, Mosa Meat, SuperMeat, and Shiok Meats.</p>

<p>The portfolio includes a cohort of the most well-capitalized companies across the pork, beef, and seafood verticals, but they are not focused exclusively on cultivated meat. They are also invested in precision fermentation (e.g., real dairy made without cows), cultivated leather, and cultivated pet food. Lastly, their investments in plant-based proteins round out a complete three-pillar, alt-protein portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Lead Investor</strong></p>

<p>Jim Mellon is the lead investor behind Agronomics. He’s made big bets on longevity, food technology, and climate change as investment meta-thematics for the next 50 years. In addition to being an investor, Mellon’s a public figure, writing investment blog posts for <a href=""https://masterinvestor.co.uk/economics/mellon-on-the-markets-gold-and-what-comes-next/"">Master Investor</a> and frequenting CNBC and financial media to offer analysis and opinions. Most relevant for investing in cultivated meat, Mellon is the author of <em>Moo’s Law, An Investor’s Guide to the New Agrarian Revolution</em>. For a deep dive into Mellon’s view on the industry, this author <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/investing-new-agrarian-revolution-interview-jim-mellon"">interviewed him</a> for Protein Report.</p>

<p>Prior to his focus on the food industry, Mellon wrote a book about the longevity industry, <a href=""https://www.juvenescence-book.com/""><em>Juvenescence</em></a>, and created a company with the same name. Juvenescence has made <a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juvenescence/recent_investments"">11 investments</a> and developed pharmacological and consumer products in-house for the longevity industry. Although the <a href=""https://www.longevity.technology/juvenescence-moves-ipo-to-second-half-of-2020/"">2020 IPO was delayed</a>, the company is valued at $500 million.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Assessment Overview</strong></p>

<p>With all this investing opportunity comes a proportional risk — especially considering that much of the tech behind cultivated meat is still largely untested. While it’s possible that investment in this sector could pan out in a similar way to what we saw with Bitcoin (where a risk-averse Wall Street didn’t see the same value in cryptocurrencies as did many speculative traders), it’s not a given so it’s important to accurately assess all possible pitfalls.</p>

<p>The risks outlined below are arranged from macro- to firm-level to cover as much of the potential risk landscape as possible but are not ranked by probability or severity.</p>

<p><strong>Macroeconomic Risk:</strong> Agronomics is listed within a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange called the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Investing in anything on an international exchange characterizing itself as “alternative” should give even the most intrepid retail investor pause when stepping off the well-trod path of the S&amp;P 500. In the event of an economic downturn, it’s likely that many of these positions would be the first to go in a liquidity crunch.</p>

<p><strong>Currency Risk:</strong> Agronomics is based in the UK and over the last five years, the British sterling exchange rate for $1 has ranged from £0.69 to £0.86. Post-Brexit, investors should be prepared for the possibility of increased volatility in exchange rates.</p>

<p><strong>Technology Scalability/Cost-Reduction: </strong>Cultivated meat could be a technology that fails, or is simply 20 years ahead of its time, much like Google Glass. There are still challenges to cost-parity with the legacy meat industry. An order of Eat Just’s cultivated chicken nuggets, for instance, is currently sold for $24 at a high-end Singapore restaurant. Further, there are <a href=""https://engrxiv.org/795su/"">analysts who remain skeptical</a> of cultivated meat’s scalability and the cost-reduction capability necessary to make the product go mainstream. The primary cost-driver is the growth media to feed the cells — and reducing this cost is the Holy Grail of the cultivated meat industry.</p>

<p>That said, the price is falling rapidly, drawing comparisons to examples cited in Mellon’s book, <a href=""https://mooslawbook.com/the-book/""><em>Moo’s Law</em></a>, and the work of Ron Shigeta (“<a href=""https://rshigeta.medium.com/lab-grown-meat-is-scaling-like-the-internet-540893cbaf57"">Lab-Grown Meat Is Scaling Like the Internet</a>”). Furthermore, Agronomics also holds investments in plant-based and fermentation proteins to hedge the technology risk of cultivated protein.</p>

<p><strong>Management Performance: </strong>In addition to Mellon, who serves as Agronomics’ Non-Executive Director, the board and management team includes Finance Director, <a href=""https://www.burnbrae.com/about-us/denham-eke"">Denham Eke</a>. Eke also leads the management team at the Burnbrae Group alongside Mellon. Burnbrae is a private international asset management company with a broad portfolio across financial services, IT, leisure, and life sciences.<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-chow-cfa-3a29b729/"">Anthony Chow</a> is Agronomics’ Co-founder and CFA and has been with Burnbrae since 2007. <a href=""https://www.jamjarinvestments.com/about"">Richard Reed </a>serves as Chairman and his past experience includes co-founding Innocent Drinks, which was acquired by Coca-Cola in 2013. Following his departure, Reed launched Jam Jar Investments with his Innocent Drinks co-founders. Rounding out the Agronomics team is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-giampaolo-4748a15/"">David Giampaolo</a>, who serves as a Non-Executive Director, and is the Founder and Chief Executive of Pi Capital.</p>

<p><strong>Agronomics Fund Structure: </strong>Instead of providing a dividend, Agronomics offers the flexibility to pursue products and ventures in cultivated meat with revenue generated from portfolio companies. It’s not structured as a 10-year VC fund that will be dissolved and returned to shareholders. All shares are described as common shares.</p>

<p><strong>Startup Risk: </strong>Jim<strong> </strong>Mellon has publicly stated (including in a <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brave-new-meat/id1531974488?i=1000511128752"">podcast with this writer</a>) that Agronomics intends not only to further invest in companies in this sector but to also find the white space to launch a company. This is similar to his approach with Juvenescence and, while exciting, presents additional risk beyond picking successful startups for investment.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There’s little doubt about the need for a radically new approach to global protein production and consumption. While the issues driving this need are likely top-of-mind to Protein Report readers, readily available, public-facing information about investing in this sector is still not as accessible as it should be.</p>

<p>No investment is without risk, particularly when the technology behind it is as untested by scalability and capability pressures as those in cultivated meat. However, early access to new technology in a nascent industry certainly offers its share of possibility and may be a unique opportunity for the right investor.</p>",9188,,

Still a nascent industry, with all the accompanying growing pains — the scramble for funding, siloed research as companies race to market, and looming questions of scalability — cell ag professionals are nevertheless largely undaunted by the challenges. Being in on a secret can be emboldening, no doubt, but it’s not an unearned optimism when the field’s potential is this expansive.</p>
<p>This boldness is a trait cellular agriculture shares with startup culture so it’s no surprise the two can often be found happily co-existing. Across the globe though, the locations of these startups have historically been “spiky,” as urban theorist Richard Florida first noted in 2009 — clustered in a handful of global cities. For cellular agriculture, that’s meant early footholds in Silicon Valley, Israel, Singapore, and Tokyo, among others. But that may be changing.</p>
<p>“As a country, I think Canada should definitely lean into cellular agriculture,” says Dr. Evan Fraser, Professor of Geography at the University of Guelph and Director of the <a href=""https://arrellfoodinstitute.ca/about-the-institute/"">Arrell Food Institute</a>, which conducts research that informs social, industrial, and governmental decisions necessary for building sustainable and resilient food systems. Fraser is currently leading a $100 million, 10-year research project into food technologies which will likely shape global food production in the coming years. “When we wrote the research proposal five years ago, cellular agriculture was not originally included as one of our focuses. Even recently, as an industry professional, it wasn’t on my radar, but suddenly about three years ago, I started to hear it talked about as this incredible development which would promote sustainability and unify protein.”</p>
<p>And indeed, Canada, seeing that same potential, is starting to lean into cellular agriculture. According to the Good Food Institute's <a href=""https://gfi.org/industry/"">State of the Industry Report</a>, at the end of 2020, there were more than 70 companies worldwide working in the field — and a growing number of these are based in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>The Current Landscape for Cellular Agriculture in Canada</strong></p>
<p>This February, Y-Combinator-backed startup <a href=""https://www.futurefields.io/"">Future Fields</a> announced the close of a <a href=""https://news.crunchbase.com/news/future-fields-lands-2-2m-seed-ships-first-cellular-meat-product/"">US $2.2 million seed funding round</a>. The Edmonton-based startup creates custom-culture media formulations that aim to mitigate between 55-95% of production costs currently associated with media. The funding will go toward scaling up operations — in particular, the production of their first commercial product, a proprietary FBS-free growth media called FGF2 protein. “FGF2 is exponentially cheaper than the majority of current media formulations. It varies by use case, but in general, it tends to be 1000 times cheaper,” says CEO Lejjy Gafour. Future Fields has sent out its first shipment of product to more than 20 cultivated protein companies for testing and is intent on ramping up production to fill their even more populated backlog.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Montreal-based cell-cultured milk startup Opalia is working on engineering mammary cells that mimic the secretory abilities of <em>in vivo</em> cow cells. “Our goal is to sell whole milk and/or dairy ingredients, depending on the need, to existing food and ingredient companies. They will then be able to use it in their products [...] in lesser thought-about applications [...] such as soap and cookies. If these companies can market their products as 'vegan' or 'animal-free,' [...] there is an important value-added component,” says CEO Jennifer Côté. “We think that the dairy industry is not where it needs to be, environmentally. Personally, I don’t think that the majority of consumers would be willing to dramatically change their habits and adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, and so we need to be able to produce the same foods that people know and love, just without the animal.”</p>
<p>“What many cultivated meat startups are working on are in the forms of processed or mechanically separated cultivated meat. These are great for introducing the technology but won't be the final products that most people are going to accept as cellular agriculture,” says McMaster Postdoctoral Researcher Alireza Shahin-Shamsabadi. “Consumers are also going to want to see full cuts of meat. We currently have these techniques in tissue engineering and we are working on adapting them for cultivated meat to create products that are completely scaffold-free and closer to what you would actually get from animals.”</p>
<p>Despite the strides these two startups have made, some of the main challenges they cite are related to policy. According to Gafour, “One of the biggest challenges is actually access to affordable workspace that is suitable for lab equipment for a new company.” Fraser confirmed that “zoning permits will also be an obstacle for production in that it is currently unclear whether they would be considered food or biotechnology facilities.” Côté says that one of Opalia’s priorities over the next three years will be getting regulatory approval for their products from Health Canada. “Currently, the definitions of terms such as “meat” and “dairy” do not include what we and other cellular agriculture companies are aiming to do.”</p>
<p><strong>Canada Is Busy Marking Milestones</strong></p>
<p>In March, national not-for-profit <a href=""https://www.cellag.ca/"">Cellular Agriculture Canada</a> (CAC) held the <a href=""https://www.proteinreport.org/events/cellular-agriculture-and-canadian-regulatory-framework"">first panel</a> involving Canadian government officials to initiate the discussion of federal regulation of cellular agriculture products. “This was a significant milestone for Canada because it is extremely important that policymakers are made aware of what is going on. The earlier they are involved in the conversations, the better the policies will be,” says co-founder Ahmed Khan. “When CAC was co-founded, we were interested in unifying professionals in order to advocate for a fair and appropriate regulatory framework.”</p>
<p>Khan is also the Founder and Editor of <a href=""https://cell.ag"">CellAgri</a> which, like Protein Report, is a site focused on sharing current developments in the cellular agriculture industry. “I first learned about cellular agriculture in 2017 [...] and I wanted to get involved as soon as possible,” Khan says. “However, I found it hard to get regular updates. I started CellAgri to be a homepage where readers can come to learn anything and everything.” Since then, CellAgri has published numerous investment reports, hosted global events, created an email miniseries, and published an ebook with the intention of expanding awareness regarding the field.</p>
<p>“In addition to advocating for fair regulations, CAC was intended to build a community where people could connect and continue to advance the field,'' says co-founder and previous Executive Director Yadira Tejeda-Saldana (who has since become the Research Collaborations Director at <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/"">New Harvest</a>). “I saw CAC as an organization that would bring together different stakeholders and draw them into the conversation through education and through events used as a platform to convey their thoughts.”</p>
<p>This past April, New Harvest announced a <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/cellular-agriculture-food-security-canada/"">collaborative research project</a> in partnership with Dr. Lenore Newman and Dr. Robert Newell at the University of the Fraser Valley <a href=""https://www.ufv.ca/food-agriculture-institute/"">Food and Agriculture Institute</a> (FAI) exploring the potential of localized cellular agriculture systems in Canada. “Understandably and importantly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the technical aspect of the field,” says Dr. Lenore Newman, Director of the FAI and Associate Professor at the University of the Fraser Valley. “This project, which we will be starting in September, will instead be focused on the social and economic dimensions of how this technology will be rolled out in Canada.” In particular, one of the focuses of the study will be regarding food security.</p>
<p>“One of the prevalent concerns with cellular agriculture is that it will displace many existing jobs in agriculture which is a large national industry. Using the Fraser Valley as a case study, we want to see if this technology can be configured in such a way to supply more jobs and increase reliable access to nutritious food.”</p>
<p>Newman has <a href=""https://www.genomebc.ca/projects/dairy-2-0-exploring-policy-implications-and-public-perceptions-of-cellular-agriculture"">previously conducted research</a> exploring the implications of public policy within cellular agriculture. “As we go from bench science to scaling, policy becomes increasingly important. In looking at what kind of landscape we will want for this field in Canada and what we need in order to get there, it becomes apparent that one of the most significant gaps is within regulation.” Although public awareness is generally included in the realm of policy, Newman says that she does not anticipate public awareness being a significant obstacle. “The main driver for the public is cost and labor equity. If consumers have a better, cheaper option, why wouldn’t they choose it? […] And though animal and environmental protection tends to be a secondary factor in widespread consumer decisions, we do have a historic precedent of transitioning away from the systems that induce cruelty.”</p>
<p><strong>How Canadian Cellular Agriculture Moves Forward</strong></p>
<p>Despite these products’ forecasted success, cellular agriculture will still be viewed by some Canadian industries as an unwelcome disruptor but there’s still time to work proactively to shift public opinion.</p>
<p>“From a global perspective, many of the ways we produce livestock are unsustainable,” says Fraser. “But we also have to acknowledge that livestock is currently a very important aspect of the Canadian economy. It underpins the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people around the world and the traditional consumption of game is integral to many Indigenous cultures. So while it looks like cell ag will provide a lot of sustainability benefits, we need to be cognizant of how we navigate these potential drawbacks. The last thing we want to do is alienate people.”</p>
<p>Fraser suggests that the main way we can prevent this is thoughtful implementation. “One of the main tenets of sustainable development is social sustainability. As an example, we don’t want cellular agriculture to be to food production what video streaming became to the movie rental business. We should be aiming for a more harmonious integration between livestock and all types of alternative proteins in which we work together to help people adapt.”</p>
<p>Fraser stresses that above all else, the emerging technology has shown that we need to redefine agriculture more broadly. “We typically think of food production as happening in the Prairies and the Maritimes. But, these disruptive food technologies that are coming online — not just cellular agriculture but also fermentation, vertical farming — are being deployed in urban and urban-adjacent areas. We need to reconsider how we understand and even define agri-food systems moving forward.”</p>
<p>In the future, Tejeda-Saldana says that she would like to see more public funding and support for pre-competitive research, particularly in interdisciplinary studies. “Cellular agriculture is a new interdisciplinary field, so funding that helps to drive early stage research forward could help create the knowledge and education necessary to advance the field,” she says. “The other gap is talent. As the industry keeps maturing, we need more people to fill in different roles — from research and policy to industry and more. At the moment, we don’t really have educational programs for training new people entering the field. This could look like undergraduate programs that focus on cellular agriculture or training courses that help existing professionals transition to this new industry.”</p>
<p>Shahin-Shamsabadi says that one of the hallmarks of a thriving national landscape would be a range of companies represented. “Not just companies working on engineering the final products, but also ones that focus on each step of the supply chain — cell lines, culture media, bioreactors, and even post-processing and distribution’.</p>
<p>Though perhaps not thought of as immediately as startup magnets like Silicon Valley, Singapore, or Israel, it would be a mistake to overlook the innovation culture of Canada. The outlook for cellular agriculture there is highly optimistic — in no small part due to a determination borne of being too often overlooked and underestimated.</p>
<p>“It’s very exciting,” says Côté of shifting consumer attitudes about cell-based products, adding what could also be a fitting coda for the industry’s potential within Canada: “This is feasible and this is the future.”</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>What is antimicrobial resistance and why is it a problem?</strong></p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microbes develop the ability to survive or grow in the presence of the drugs designed to kill them. This renders existing medicines less effective at fighting infections, which means those infections become more deadly.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/index.html"">According to the CDC</a>, “Each year in the U.S., at least 2.8 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and more than 35,000 people die.” Worldwide this figure is 700,000 deaths, and the Antimicrobial Resistance Industry Alliance projects that number will <a href=""https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/why-amr/"">rise to 10 million</a> by 2050. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"">has said</a> “a lack of effective antibiotics is as serious a security threat as a sudden and deadly disease outbreak.”</p>

<p>The effects of such infections are not just health related; one strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria alone classified as “urgent” by the CDC was associated with <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf"">$281 million</a> in healthcare costs in 2017. Global healthcare costs incurred due to antibiotic-resistant infections are expected to reach <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/09/18/by-2050-drug-resistant-infections-could-cause-global-economic-damage-on-par-with-2008-financial-crisis"">$1 trillion</a> per year by 2050.</p>

<p>Drug-resistant pathogens not only compromise human health, they also jeopardize the well being of livestock and wildlife populations that play vital roles in the environment. For this reason, the CDC calls antibiotic resistance a <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf"">One Health</a> challenge in which “the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment.”</p>

<p><strong>How does antimicrobial resistance work?</strong></p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs are exposed to drugs, develop mechanisms of resistance against those drugs, and pass on these mechanisms to other members of their population. By the principle of natural selection, when exposed to a drug, the germs that survive are those that contain a mutation more effective at withstanding the drug. These germs then outlive their ill-adapted counterparts, reproduce more, and their mutation becomes characteristic of the entire population. The more a given drug is used, the more opportunities a germ species has to evolve a characteristic that can resist it.</p>

<p>In addition to inheritance of these traits as the result of evolution within a population, resistant elements can also be transferred between individual bacteria.

<p>The process of microbes becoming resistant to drugs is naturally occurring, but it is expedited when those drugs are constantly present in an environment. This can happen through the overuse of fungicides and pesticides in commercial agriculture, as well as with antibiotics used to treat infections in patients and mitigate the spread of disease among livestock.</p>

<p>For instance, penicillin was the first commercialized antibiotic discovered in 1941 by Alex Flemming and was widely used during the second half of the twentieth century. During that time, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html"">three significant germs</a> developed that were resistant to penicillin: Staphylococcus aureus in 1942, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1967, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 1975. This has limited the modern use of penicillin and related drugs today.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/antibiotics-are-contaminating-the-world-s-rivers/"">World Economic Forum</a>, the overuse of antibiotics is “leading us into a post-antibiotic world in which people will once again die from common infections and minor injuries.”</p>

<p><strong>What does it have to do with protein?</strong></p>

<p>Although antibiotics are generally thought of in the context of treating infections within our healthcare systems, that’s not where most of the world’s antibiotics are actually used.</p>

<p>In the United States, <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/antimicrobial_resistance/docs/amr_studies_2015_am-in-agri-and-env.pdf"">more than 70%</a> of all medically important antibiotics are used in livestock, while in Canada <a href=""http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/animalcare/amr/facts/17-017.htm"">more than 80%</a> of all antibiotics are used in agriculture. Globally, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766021/"">around 73%</a> of all antibiotics are used in animals grown for food. <span style=""font-size: 1rem;"">By 2030, the total amount of antimicrobials used in food animals is <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6358/1350"">projected to increase</a> by as much as 53% over 2013 levels</span><span style=""font-size: 1rem;"">.</span></p>

<p>Why are farm animals consuming so many antimicrobials?</p>

<p>“The high population density of modern intensively managed livestock operations results in sharing of both commensal flora and pathogens, which can be conducive to rapid dissemination of infectious agents. As a result, livestock in these environments commonly require aggressive infection management strategies,” explains Timothy F. Landers et al in a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234384/"">2012 paper</a>. They go on to detail how antibiotics are not only used to treat and prevent disease in such environments, but are also used to enhance animal growth.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.fairr.org/article/improving-antibiotics-stewardship-in-livestock-supply-chains/"">FAIRR Initiative</a>, an investor network worth $38 trillion, “To be profitable, companies have relied on the routine mass medication of farm animals with antibiotics, both as a means to increase feed efficiency and to reduce mortality.” In their <a href=""https://www.fairr.org/index/"">Protein Producer Index</a>, FAIRR ranks 60 of the world’s largest meat, fish, and dairy producers and has <a href=""https://www.fairr.org/article/improving-antibiotics-stewardship-in-livestock-supply-chains/"">found 70%</a> to be “high risk” for antibiotics, indicating “extremely poor levels of antibiotic stewardship.”</p>

<p>As explained by the Director of the Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses at WHO, <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"">Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima</a>, “scientific evidence demonstrates that overuse of antibiotics in animals can contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The volume of antibiotics used in animals is continuing to increase worldwide, driven by a growing demand for foods of animal origin, often produced through intensive animal husbandry.”</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.meatmythcrushers.com/myths/myth-antibiotic-use-in-livestock-production-is-a-human-health-risk.html"">Some stakeholders</a> argue that strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which develop in farm animals do not pose risks to human health. However, other researchers have found decades of evidence indicating otherwise. In their <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234384/"">2012 paper</a>, Timothy F. Landers et al cite studies showing “Associations between antibiotic use in food animals and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from those animals have been detected in observational studies as well as in randomized trials. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin have been observed in the environment surrounding livestock farming operations, on meat products available for purchase in retail food stores, and as the cause of clinical infections and subclinical colonization in humans.”</p>

<p>The CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/challenges/antibiotic-resistance.html"">also notes</a> that “when animals are slaughtered and processed for food, resistant bacteria can contaminate meat or other animal products” leading to antibiotic-resistant intestinal infections if these foods are handled or consumed. For example, a notable February 2019 American <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/infantis-10-18/index.html"">outbreak</a> of a multidrug resistant strain of salmonella was linked to the consumption of raw and undercooked chicken.</p>

<p>Overuse of antibiotics in livestock doesn’t only risk contaminating food products. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378521/"">Up to 90%</a> of antibiotics ingested by livestock are secreted in urine and waste which is then dispersed in fertilizer and surface runoff contributing to diffuse environmental contamination. In 2019, the first global study of <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/antibiotics-are-contaminating-the-world-s-rivers/"">antibiotics in the world’s rivers</a> found that two thirds of the world’s rivers are polluted by antibiotics with certain concentrations exceeding 300 times above what is considered safe.</p>

<p><strong>How can antimicrobial resistance be mitigated?</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, the CDC’s <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf"">AR Threats Report</a> listed 18 resistant germs as either “urgent,” “serious,” or a “concerning threat.” In order to mitigate the further development and spread of antibiotic resistance, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/food.html"">they recommend</a> improving antibiotic use so they are administered only when necessary rather than as a routine procedure.</p>

<p>In the United States, the USDA along with the FDA and EPA administers the US <a href=""https://www.fsis.usda.gov/science-data/data-sets-visualizations/residue-chemistry"">National Residue Program</a> which attempts to reduce the amount of antibiotic residues (small quantities of unabsorbed antibiotics) entering the food supply. Since 2006, the European Union <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"">has banned</a> the use of antibiotics for growth promotion. The WHO <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"">also suggests</a> that “antibiotics used in animals should be selected from those listed as being ‘least important’ to human health, and not from those classified as ‘highest priority’ and ‘critically important.’”</p>

<p>But policy isn’t the only available lever for addressing the problem — investors and food producers also have a role to play.</p>

<p>According to the FAIRR Initiative, “Investors now recognise that the routine non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock production is a leading cause of rising antimicrobial resistance worldwide.” <a href=""https://www.fairr.org/article/improving-antibiotics-stewardship-in-livestock-supply-chains/"">They report</a> that between 2010 and 2019, 24 shareholder resolutions on antibiotics overuse in livestock have been filed in the United States. FAIRR has also developed a <a href=""https://antibioticsstatement.fairr.org/policy/"">Best Practice Policy</a> for food producers and retailers, and coordinated a global <a href=""https://antibioticsstatement.fairr.org/"">investor statement</a> on antibiotics stewardship whose signatories include 75 investors managing over $3 trillion in assets. In 2020, FAIRR, along with the Access to Medicine Foundation, PRI, and the UK Government, launched <a href=""https://amrinvestoraction.org/about"">Investor Action on AMR</a>, a new initiative to leverage investor influence to combat drug-resistant superbugs.</p>

<p>The issue is also starting to see some push coming from the public; many consumers are increasingly favoring meat products with <a href=""https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/import/RaisingClaims.pdf"">label claims</a> such as “No Antibiotics Ever,” “Raised without Antibiotics,” and “No Added Antibiotics.” But such all-or-nothing approaches are probably not the solution — after all, just like humans, animals also sometimes get sick and need medicine.</p>

<p>In a 2017 <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6358/1350"">article</a> published in <em>Science,</em> an international group of biologists, policy, and disease specialists proposed a three-pronged approach to reducing antimicrobial use in livestock in order to mitigate the development of drug-resistant infections in humans and animals. Through a combination of policies that cap permissible levels of veterinary antibiotic consumption, reduce meat consumption, and raise the cost of veterinary antimicrobials, the global use of antimicrobials in food animals could be lowered by as much as 80% by 2030. Even if only the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and China implemented just some of these strategies, global antimicrobial use in animals could be reduced by as much as 60%.</p>",8812,"Global antimicrobial consumption in livestock.

<p>What distinguishes a muscle cell from a fat cell or a skin cell? The answer is “gene expression.” More precisely, the particular combination of genes that are “turned on or off” in a cell which dictates cellular morphology and function. Although genome sequencing and analysis have been employed vastly in the study of disease and pharmaceuticals, there has been little application in the emerging field of cellular agriculture.</p>

<p>The process of cultivating meat requires exposing stem cells to the environmental cues necessary for them to proliferate and then differentiate into the specialized cells which eventually mature into the tissue characteristic of meat.</p>

<p>As most consumers are familiar with, the majority of meat products are composed of muscle tissue with small quantities of fat. A challenge then becomes finding a way to ensure these initial stem cells reliably differentiate into some combination of muscle cells and fat cells.</p>

<p>In thinking about how this can be done, the natural place to start is by considering how the process is already accomplished in vivo, as most in vitro bioprocesses are based on replicating the existing bodily functions responsible for the development of specialized tissue.</p>

<p>In living organisms, cell function operates according to the central dogma of molecular biology, which specifies that DNA transcribes mRNA which translates into proteins. These proteins are what dictate the role of that cell and is essentially what characterizes a cell as a blood cell as opposed to a neuron, for instance. The transcriptome of a cell is the set of genes which are translated from mRNA into proteins, and so while almost every cell in the mammalian body has the same genome, they may have different “isoforms” of a transcriptome. This ultimately leads to different sets of proteins being created, thus leading to distinct cell specializations.</p>

<p>As such, a change in a cell’s function is caused by a change in its transcriptome as a response to external or internal stimuli such as development or exposure to a drug. During this process, specific genes are either up-regulated (expressed more) or down-regulated (repressed more). A gene is considered significantly differentially expressed if it is upregulated or downregulated beyond a predetermined threshold. Differential gene expression analysis is the process of identifying such genes by comparing two or more transcriptomes.</p>

<p>This year, I entered my project <em>Lab to Table: A differential gene expression analysis of RNA-sequenced bovine stem cells <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> myocytes</em> into the Ottawa Regional Science Fair. The purpose of this study was to design a bioinformatics pipeline to conduct a differential gene expression analysis on the transcriptomes of a bovine embryonic stem cell (ESC) and an adult myocyte (precursor to muscle tissue) in order to identify the genes responsible for bovine myocyte differentiation. The idea is that if we can find what these genes are, we can selectively activate them within stem cells so that in a cellular agriculture bioprocess they reliably differentiate into myocytes characteristic of meat that consumers would be willing to buy.</p>

<p>The two samples used here were obtained using RNA-sequencing (similar to genome sequencing but for mRNA) and are available on the NCBI Genbank database. They both came from bovine longissimus muscle — one from an ESC and the other from a myocyte. The differential gene expression analysis was run using a pipeline (series of algorithms) on the Galaxy Project public web server pictured below.</p>

<p>Running this pipeline and filtering the data resulted in 23 genes that were significantly differentially expressed: 10 of which were upregulated and 13 of which were downregulated over the process of development from a bovine ESC into a myocyte. These genes were then queried against the DAVID database which contains the functional annotation of genes across many organisms. Nine genes in particular stood out as being related to the development of muscle tissue.</p>

<p>In terms of next steps for this particular project, it would be useful to actually selectively upregulate or downregulate a subset of these genes within an ESC and monitor how the cell’s differentiation into a myocyte is impacted in practice. It would also be interesting to run a similar study regarding differentiation into adipocytes to further explore the possibility of creating cultivated products which have a balance of both tissue types. Comparing the gene analogs of different species of cows or the transcriptomes of cows raised on different diets would help to understand how the resulting modifications in gene expression influence organoleptic properties such as taste and texture of the resulting meat.</p>",8779,"Image source: Project board by Avery Parkinson/Youth Sciences Canada",

<p>How do you feed 10 billion people? It’s a question that intrigued Dr. David Block, professor and Marvin Sands department chair of the viticulture and enology programs at the University of California Davis (UC Davis). It’s also a question that won’t be hypothetical for much longer. As Block explained in the school’s recent public webinar, “<a href=""https://youtu.be/FYy26D5jg7Q"" target=""_blank"">Growing Real Beef Without the Moo</a>,” in order “to be able to feed 10 billion people simultaneously in 2050, we’ll need to produce as much [food] over the next 50 years, as we have in the history of humanity up to this point.”</p>

<p>One of the possible solutions researchers are working on is the development of cultivated meat. If you aren’t yet familiar with the concept, don’t fret; it seems the industry itself hasn’t quite decided which term—cultivated, cultured, cell-based, slaughter-free, or clean meat—to land on. Whatever the name, though, the process to create it is the same: scientists extract cells from animals and nourish those cells in an optimal mix of growth media (more on this later) to the point of what scientists call “differentiation” (they become muscle or fat cells, for instance) until the end product can be harvested as meat. Unlike recent alternative protein advancements that have led to products like Beyond Meat or the Impossible Burger, cultivated meat <em>is</em> real meat. But whether it can feed an exploding population better than its conventionally produced counterpart is, like many other billion-dollar ideas, largely a question of scalability.</p>

<p>UC Davis is now the first public institution to receive federal funds for research that will attempt to answer that question. The Northern California school was recently awarded a five-year grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for up to $3.55 million through its “Growing Convergence Research” program. Not only does the grant represent the first federal funds earmarked to aid in cultivated meat research, its selection criteria actually had nothing to do with cellular agriculture, as Block was careful to point out during his portion of the presentation. Instead, the NSF invited researchers to propose solutions to compelling social problems. And what could be more compelling—and urgent—than trying to figure out how to feed 10 billion people.</p>

<p>Though cultivated meat was little more than speculation five years ago, it’s already become reality, albeit one with a caveat. To paraphrase futurist and author, William Gibson, the future of meat is already here—if unevenly distributed. While many labs have successfully created cultivated meat, most private labs are engaged in a race to market that precludes the sharing of processes and results; industry insiders believe these independent labs may be doing research and development that’s the cultivated meat equivalent of reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>There’s currently only one restaurant in the world—a tony, members-only club in Singapore—that offers cell-based chicken on its menu. But if cell-based meat does hold the answer to feeding billions more people, it needs to be much more accessible. That’s one of the reasons many in the alt protein community (the term applied to the loose collection of companies creating alternatives to traditionally animal-based foods) are excited by the promise of the NSF grant. Not only is its award a tacit endorsement of cultivated meat research, UC Davis’s work will represent a new open science approach to cultivated meat, one where research findings will be publicly shared, instead of siloed by the need for race-to-market secrecy.</p>

<p>It was a presentation by a speaker from the Good Food Institute (GFI) at a 2018 convention of food innovation and engineering that first piqued Block’s interest about the problems associated with meat production, as well as the untapped possibility. Around the same time, two of Block’s PhD students, Ted O’Neil and Zach Cosenza, came to him with an interest in working on cell-based meat media optimization, the life science process for creating the most auspicious environment for cellular growth.</p>

<p>Sensing an opportunity, Block’s graduate students quickly secured two grants with the cellular agriculture research institute New Harvest in 2019, and Block received a third grant from GFI in early 2020 to begin research into alternatives to conventional meat production. At the end of 2019, the school established the UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium, a multi-disciplinary group of 30 researchers who were all interested in the nascent field of cultivated meat. School researchers have been quick to point out, however, that the university views cultivated meat as a market supplement <em>to</em> and not a replacement <em>for </em>conventionally farmed meat—an important distinction at a school with deep farming roots where the student population is known as the “aggies.”</p>

<p>As a land-grant institution that arguably put the California wine industry on the map (partly by creating a school-to-industry talent pipeline), UC Davis is uniquely positioned to deliver on the promise of cell-based meat. As Block put it when explaining his areas of research, cultivated meat “requires the deep integration of stem cell engineering, tissue culture, animal and meat science, experimental process optimization and artificial intelligence, biochemical engineering, industrial fermentation and manufacturing, food science and engineering, materials science and biomaterials, sensory science, techno-economic modeling, life cycle analysis, and consumer science.”</p>

<p>By taking a multidisciplinary approach to its research, UC Davis has the potential to rally public resources for public good in a way that’s not before been applied to the science of cultivated meat—all while integrating principles from the school’s noted winemaking and biotech programs to the new research.</p>

<p>Aside from the promise of what open research could mean to the advancement of cultivated meat, the product may also benefit from a surprisingly well-worn path to regulatory approval. As Eric Schulze, vice president of product and regulation at cell-based meat startup Memphis Meats and co-presenter alongside Dr. Block at the recent presentation, noted, “The FDA and USDA are not doing anything new [with regard to future product regulation]. They’re using existing pathways to regulate the safety of these products.” So while the idea of cultivated meat may require some consumer education to get potential customers to see it as something other than “lab-grown meat” (a term the industry abhors), the actual scientific processes at play are not unknown to the federal regulators who’ll be assessing its safety.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Denneal Jamison-McClung, Director of the UC Davis Biotech Program and co-founder of the UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium, “A lot of the technologies around cellular meat are things that have been adapted from other biotech industries like industrial enzymes or […] tissue culture for biomedical purposes.”</p>

<p>Those industries, however, tend to have much deeper pockets than their food counterparts and product costs offset by insurers. So while we may be inching closer to the day a few years from now when we can pick up a pound of cultivated ground beef at the store, the price will need to be within reach for the average consumer.</p>

<p>Before cultivated meat arrives in supermarkets though, its viability is going to be tested, not just by regulators and consumer tastes but by its own current limitations. The Davis team, for instance, has several objectives they’ll be expected to meet over the next five years of the grant, including, “developing stable stem cell lines from which cultivated meat can be grown; developing inexpensive, plant-based media in which to grow the cells; and assessing the nutritional value, stability and sensory qualities of cultivated meat products.” Each of these presents its own daunting use-case scenario challenges that will need to be anticipated and overcome.</p>

<p>One of the most pressing issues surrounding cultivated meat research is the industry’s current reliance on the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the most commonly used supplement in the nutrient broth where cells are cultured—a step in the development of cell lines that needs to happen for an undifferentiated animal cell to ultimately grow and become the tissue we recognize as meat. Currently, the extraction procedure is not just prohibitively expensive, it’s a byproduct of the slaughtering process, meaning a calf still has to die in order for researchers to use its fetal blood to create the FBS that’s used to cultivate cells. The FBS issue is something almost everyone in the cultivated meat industry seems to be working on in order to create a scalable alternative to its use.</p>

<p>As to the nutritional value and sensory qualities, the UC Davis team seems to be taking a pragmatic and consumer-centric approach. As Dr. Jamison-McClung put it when sharing some of the discussion among researchers, the hope is that “startup companies in this space realize that they are a food company, because a lot of time they talk like they are a tech company, like traditional biotech. And to some extent that’s true but you really, ultimately, are a food company and if nobody wants your food, they’re not really going to stay in business.”</p>

<p>And while UC Davis doesn’t have to worry about staying in business, it’s evident that members of its academic consortium share an appreciation for both the spotlight and the pressure the grant puts on their research and its urgency. The hope is, though, that by becoming an academic nexus for cultivated meat research and by sharing key findings, the whole industry can move much faster—and we’ll be that much closer to having another option on the dinner table.</p>",8623,"UC Davis PhD student Ted O’Neil working on cell media optimization for cultured meat in Professors David Block and Keith Baar’s lab.

In order to solve this problem, Cellular Agriculture Australia has developed an online resource called “Pathways into Cellular Agriculture.”","<p>“The number one question I get from students interested in cell ag is ‘What do I need to study to get into the field?’” Director of Cellular Agriculture Australia Dr. Bianca Le is also frequently queried by professionals wondering how they can apply their expertise to cellular agriculture.</p>

<p>A hallmark of many thriving industries is that people interested in getting involved know how to do so, or at least are able to easily find information pointing them in the right direction. But with cellular agriculture being such a nascent and cross-disciplinary field, it is not always apparent what skills students should learn or how professionals might apply existing skills in order to launch or develop a career in the industry.</p>

<p>“There is no shortage of intelligent and passionate people who want to get involved in cellular agriculture, but there are few resources directing them to the various pathways into the field, especially when it comes to Australia,” explains Le.</p>

<p>In order to solve this problem, Cellular Agriculture Australia has developed an online resource called “Pathways into Cellular Agriculture.” The <a href=""https://pathways.cellularagricultureaustralia.org/"">pathways tool</a>, as it is affectionately called, is an interactive page on the Cellular Agriculture Australia (CAA) website, through which students and jobseekers can explore different entry points into the field.</p>

<p>Cultured meat researcher and CAA Secretary Lisa Musgrove, who helped coordinate the tool’s content, explained the main intuition governing the design of this resource was that “users might be coming at it from the perspective of either wanting to solve a particular research problem or wanting to apply an existing area of expertise to cellular agriculture.”</p>

<p>As such, the tool’s information is divided into two broad topics: “Problems to Solve” and “Majors.” Each of these is further divided into more specific subtopics. The <em>Problems</em> section lists research gaps and current white spaces, while <em>Majors</em> lists the disciplines that can be applied to each problem. These ultimately direct the user to a page displaying each of the Australian Universities with research laboratories that have the capacity to solve the selected problems in cellular agriculture.</p>

<p>Work on the pathways tool started in August 2020. Musgrove says that the CAA team began to think about how an interactive tool could help students and graduates connect academic course offerings to real research problems in cell ag. “We already had an idea about what the main research focus areas were, so we looked into those a little deeper by accessing the great resources offered by the Good Food Institute and New Harvest, as well as various papers that have been published recently.”</p>

<p>The team then browsed local universities for course offerings and compared them with the positions being offered by various cell ag companies in order to get a sense of which disciplines relate to each research problem.</p>

<p>Team member Jo Tunna, who comes from a background in business development, explains, “One of the most helpful resources we used was the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hAl_qJdEA6yfvnX266RcOrUzFbeAa4uChioF-X2byCQ/edit"">GFI’s student guide to navigating the alternative protein space</a> along with a series of <em>Medium</em> posts made by <a href=""https://medium.com/@wild_type/wild-type-food-for-thought-4-4031781e39a6"">Wildtype</a>. Those explored what the cell ag industry looks like today in terms of talent, focus, and industry maturity as well as how this is likely to shift in the years ahead.”</p>

<p>The rapid development of the industry was one of the most interesting things Le noticed during the process. “The field is moving so quickly, it can be hard to keep up! The types of jobs that are required for this emerging industry has changed rapidly over the past two years, especially in Australia.”</p>

<p>Her team has noticed that diversity of thought is one of the field’s most valued attributes. “When you look at the same role across different cell ag companies, there is no one common way to get into the field. In fact, companies often prefer non-traditional pathways for technical positions because this industry is so unlike any other — you really need to be a lateral thinker. We knew early on that we had to incorporate that philosophy into the pathways tool.”</p>

<p>Musgrove says that she “was surprised at the large range of study fields available to students in [Australia]. It’s great to see that many of our universities are at the cutting edge of so many areas in biomedicine, biotechnology, and engineering. This certainly bodes well for developing local talent in the cell ag space.”</p>

<p>CAA was also able to use the opportunity to further grow their volunteer community. CAA volunteer and University of Tasmania student Kianie Langer says “I was interested in contributing to the pathways project because I’d like to see cell ag blossom, and I believe the pathways tool is a fantastic opportunity to show people of various educational backgrounds that cell ag is diverse, having the potential to encompass many fields of study and work.”</p>

Looking toward this future, it’s worth considering how valuable these companies could be.","<h2><strong>How BlueNalu could become the world’s most valuable seafood company</strong></h2>

<p>Although cultivated meat isn’t yet available to consumers outside Singapore, more than 30 startups have raised venture funding and several have introduced product tastings or proofs of concept. Over the next two years, many will bring products to market leading to acquisitions and IPOs as the industry matures. Looking toward this future, it’s worth considering how valuable cultivated meat companies could be.</p>

<p>So far, much of the focus has been on the cultivated beef industry, highlighted by Memphis Meats’ $180 million in funding. But cultivating seafood at commercial scales may be easier due to advantages of fish cell tolerances to pH, temperature, and oxygen levels [1]. A trio of VC-funded US companies are currently pursuing this vertical.</p>

<p>Among these three, BlueNalu leads the pack. With $84 million raised to date [2], the San Diego-based startup is the most well funded in the cultivated seafood space. In January of 2021, they closed a $60 million convertible debt round with the intent to produce a pilot facility by the end of the year [3]. The company’s first product will be mahi mahi after which they will add bluefin tuna and other species.</p>

<p>Wildtype is focused on salmon and has raised $16 million for their Seattle-based venture [2]. Finless Foods rounds out the cohort with $3.5 million in funding [2] to develop cultivated bluefin tuna. Like many of the other startups in this space, they are based out of the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>Pre-revenue companies are difficult to value, and cultivated meat startups especially so being in a nascent industry using technology less than ten years old. But the opportunity these companies are pursuing is enormous. Fish and seafood make up a $1 trillion global market and $102 billion domestic market [4].</p>

<p>The below table shows a sample of the largest incumbent seafood companies in the world. The industry is less consolidated than beef and poultry, which are dominated by a smaller number of companies. Product lines cover wild-caught fish, farm-raised aquaculture, and combinations of both. The average P/E ratio (15.5) of this cohort is comparable to the broader Farming/Agriculture average (26.0) [5].</p>

<p>However, valuing cultivated seafood startups against the legacy fishing industry is challenging. Although the end product from both sectors is fish, the similarity ends there. The technology and cost drivers are completely different. Fleets of fishing vessels and aquaculture lakes will be replaced by bioreactors and growth media — even a body of water is unnecessary. Seafood supply chains spanning thousands of miles will be replaced by cultivated fish facilities located near the populations they serve. Landlocked countries will be able to domestically produce all of the saltwater seafood they need to meet demand to ensure food security.</p>

<p>Plant-based protein companies offer another potential comparison for cultivated meat valuations. Beyond Meat’s 2019 IPO saw the company skyrocket to a $3.8 billion valuation and demonstrated investor excitement in plant-based protein. Impossible Foods raised $200 million in August of 2020 and is estimated to be worth $4 billion [6]. However, it’s likely cultivated meat companies will have more defensible IP than plant-based protein companies [7] as well as a larger potential market of consumers unwilling to move away from animal-based meat.</p>

<p>Looking to other industries offers more valuation comparisons. Cultivated seafood companies will create a high-volume, physical product in a centralized facility. They will require a technical workforce and defendable IP to be successful. In many ways, cultivated seafood is more similar to the semiconductor industry than legacy seafood operations. Although not a perfect analog (facility lifetimes, material costs, etc.), consider the potential value of these startups with a semiconductor enterprise value-to-sales ratio as they scale to meet the tremendous demand for global seafood.</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise Value Ratio</strong></p>

<p>While many established corporations are valued based on earnings, startup valuations are often determined based on revenue multiples using the enterprise value-to-sales ratio. Enterprise value (EV) is calculated as follows:</p>

<p><strong>EV = Market Capitalization + Market Value of Debt – Cash and Equivalents</strong></p>

<p>Enterprise value of mature companies divided by sales across the aggregate can give an industry wide EV ratio. Significant to this analysis, EV ratios vary <em>considerably</em> across industries.</p>

<p><strong>EV Ratio = EV / Sales</strong></p>

<p>Using the industry average EV ratio allows a valuation of a target company by simply plugging in its sales.</p>

<p><strong>Target Company Sales * Industry EV Ratio = Target Company EV</strong></p>

<p>New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran has generated a thorough list of industry EV ratios [5]. Among those listed, “Farming,” “Food Processing,” and “Food Wholesale” are the closest to the legacy seafood industry. Food industries have relatively low EV ratios due to cost structure and commodification. Conversely, the semiconductor industry has a much higher EV ratio. At the far end of the spectrum, internet software has one of the highest EV ratios due to the negligible variable cost associated with producing software. The business model of digital bits over physical atoms still reigns for the most profitable companies in the world.</p>

<p><strong>BlueNalu</strong></p>

<p>Focusing on BlueNalu offers a snapshot of a potential cultivated meat IPO. They are the most well capitalized among cell-based seafood startups, and they have publicly announced plans to bring a product to market by the end of 2021. BlueNalu CEO, Lou Cooperhouse, has described this facility as “Phase 3.” Ultimately, a scaled-up BlueNalu facility will be “Phase 5” and capable of producing 18 million pounds of fish per year [3].</p>

  </figure>

<p>Assuming a $5.00/pound wholesale price, this Phase 5 facility will generate annual revenues of $90 million — with a scalable model. Applying the semiconductor EV ratio to these assumptions, BlueNalu would be worth a $3.2 billion valuation with just five facilities. Once 20 are operational, they would be worth $12.8 billion and be the most valuable seafood company in the world.</p>

<p>This is a conservative estimate as high-growth startups are often valued on multiples much greater than their established competitors. Impossible Foods, for instance, only has one facility but was still able to command a $4 billion valuation in private markets. This potential valuation also does not account for licensing technology or other partnerships to develop new revenue streams, nor does it include price premiums the product could command for being free of the micro-plastics and mercury in current fish products.</p>

<p>Reducing the cost of production to achieve price parity remains an unsolved risk, but once this technical barrier is overcome, cultivated seafood companies will likely be vastly more valuable than incumbent seafood companies. Some will achieve “escape velocity” from being acquired by incumbents and either be acquired by larger food companies (Tyson, Nestle, etc.) or go for IPOs. This represents a huge potential opportunity for investors looking for exposure in the alternative protein space.</p>

<p>The confluence of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, the rapid development of new food technologies and the rising global demand for protein mean that we are on the cusp of a huge and profitable investment wave into new forms of agriculture. The greatest beneficiaries of this investment wave will be cultured and plant-based foods.</p>

<p>The worldwide plant-based meat market, excluding dairy substitutes and other plant-based foods (such as tofu), is currently estimated to be worth about US $12 billion, with sales likely to reach US $28 billion by 2025. In the USA alone, the plant-based food market rose 29 per cent from US $3.9 billion to US $5 billion, between 2017 and 2019 with the plant-based meat market increasing from US $682 million to US $939 million. When considering that these figures do not include future cultured meat sales, which I expect to be underway in some smaller protein categories and geographies by then, the industry’s cumulative potential over the next decade will be substantially higher than these projections.</p>

<p>At current consumption rates, and at current population growth projections, it is estimated that by 2050 the production of meat around the world will double, to over 500 billion kilograms per year. The world cannot sustain this level of production, when considering the scarce resources of land and water and the overuse of pesticides, fertilisers and antibiotics that such a level would necessitate. Nor can the planet afford an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, further deforestation, and the continual devastating loss of biodiversity.</p>

<p>When viewed against this backdrop, the production of alternative protein such as plant-based formulations and cell-based meat, as well as animal-free forms of producing materials, will be a key factor not only in meeting our future food needs, but, in doing so, saving our planet as well.</p>

<p>A key feature of plant-based and cultured foods is the transparency of the manufacturing process when compared to traditional animal-derived food production, as will be explained in more detail in this chapter.</p>

<p>This transparency will ultimately drive a move towards greater adoption of these products and, importantly for investors, will divert consumption dollars towards genuinely clean food.</p>

<p>Currently, most companies in the field are private, but increasing numbers are expected to go public in the next few years, offering investors the chance to participate in a major boom. In the investment section of this book, I triage what I believe to be the best of them, covering the gamut of meats, both plant- and cell-based, as well as by-products, and the ‘picks and shovels’ that are making the revolution happen.</p>

<p>In this chapter, there follows a brief description of the range of technologies used in the creation of these new foods and products; an analysis of where, how and when the resulting products will be sold; and an estimate of their market and investment potential.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the New Agrarian Revolution can be split into three main investment areas: plant-based, cellular agriculture, and enabling technologies and tools.</p>

<p>The plant-based food producers are already the subjects of heavy investor interest, and their products have been rapidly gaining market share. These plant-based foods include burgers – such as the famous <em>Beyond Burger </em>and <em>Impossible Burger </em>– but also many other meat substitutes, including chicken, pork, beef, and, of course, seafood. Included in the plant-based market are substitutes for cow’s milk made from soy, almonds, rice, and oats. There are also many animal-free product lines in snacks, pet food and baby food. While undoubtedly successful in most cases, companies involved in this sector generally have more limited intellectual property than those in the cell-cultured space, and are more reliant on superior marketing and manufacturing skills to establish their brands.</p>

<p>The second investment area is a fast-developing, yet thus far largely under-the-radar, business of using biotechnology, typically cell culture, to replicate meats, seafoods, dairy products, leathers, and proteins. This industry has the potential to create novel ‘engineered’ foods which will not relate to any existing animal or fish species.</p>

<p>This sector is most interesting from an investor’s point of view. It is at an earlier stage of development than the plant-based sector but has huge momentum behind it. In my view, its products are likely to be in wide dispersal within 10 years, if not sooner, with sales likely in the next 18 months at a small production launch.</p>

<p>The third investment area pertains to the tools-and-technologies industry that enables clean foods: namely machinery, feedstock (‘growth media’), and other elements necessary to fuel the new food revolution. There are currently some investable companies in this area, but many of the means of production are held within large companies where the effect of increased sales in this area are diluted by size, which limits their investment potential.</p>

<p>When I embarked on this book, I had no idea that the processes involved in making the spectrum of clean foods were so complex, involving high science and research and development, particularly in cellular agriculture. I have tried to describe the salient features of these processes to reduce them to a simple, bite-sized (excuse the pun!) precis, giving readers some idea of how our food will be produced in future.</p>

<p>While there is a wide variety of new foods and therefore a wide variety of production methods, plant-based foods are generally produced by extrusion. Cell-based products are produced in bioreactors, where different cell lines are provided with nutrients. These include sugars, salts, vital amino acids and growth factors (hormones) that replicate the natural process of growing meat on the body of an animal, without the slaughter and other downsides of traditional animal husbandry.</p>

<p>There are, in addition, other forms of food made by biotech processes, including yeast-based foods and proteins made – literally – from thin air and electricity.</p>

<p>Cellular agriculture still lags behind in comparison to the production and commercialisation curves of the plant-based sector, but it is catching up rapidly, and offers the prospect of defensible IP, lower costs, and greater efficiencies in production. I estimate that in 10 years, products made in bioreactors will be sold at scale in most parts of the world.</p>

<p>This is the industry about which I hold the most optimistic viewpoint, and the one into which I would recommend the highest investment concentration, with portfolio additions from the plant-based foods industry, which is here and now with its products.</p>

<p class=""text-align-center"">***</p>

<p>The New Agrarian Revolution is happening now, and as with every new promising industry, there will be plenty of public companies to choose from in due course. At the moment, however, the pickings on the public markets are few and far between, because most of the promising companies are sequencing through their various pre-IPO listing rounds of funding.</p>

<p>These rounds start with a founders’ round, then go onto a seed round, followed by a number of alphabetically named ‘Series’ rounds (Series A, Series B, etc.), and are typical of angel- and venture capital-funded companies.</p>

<p>This book contains a list of all of the promising and not-so-promising companies involved in the cell ag, plant-based, alt-materials, and picks and shovels companies, rated by myself and my investment colleagues, Anthony Chow and Laura Turner.</p>

<p>Many of these companies are rated on the basis of our perception of quality of management, business plan, the competitive landscape for their products, and valuation, which generally is referenced either to open rounds of financing or our expectation of valuation at the next round.</p>

<p>The few available listed companies are rated also, although I recommend that investors do not buy the shares of ‘traditional’ food producers on the basis of any exposure to ‘new’ food or materials companies, or to their own-brand plant-based foods, as the impact of these will generally be very diluted in the context of the sheer size of these companies. There are a few investable companies that are already public, including the excellent Beyond Meat, and Sartorius in picks and shovels. But generally speaking, investors must either find a way of investing directly, or wait for IPOs to come along, or invest in a collective vehicle.</p>

<p>In a bit more detail:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Wait for promising cell ag and cell-material companies, as well as picks and shovel companies, to go public. I would recommend that anyone who is interested in participating in the IPOs of any of these companies contact them directly and put themselves on relevant mailing lists.</li>
	<li>Investors who have a bit more to spend (and by this I would suggest US $100,000 per company) might put themselves forwards as candidates to invest in whatever the next round of funding a company is contemplating, and contact the company directly.</li>
	<li>Invest in an investment vehicle that covers the area. At the moment, the only vehicle I know of for retail investors to gain direct exposure to cell ag is Agronomics, in which I have a major interest. However, I expect such vehicles to multiply as the New Agrarian Revolution gathers pace, and the website will be updated accordingly as they appear.  </li>
	<li>There will be some standalone successes, including Beyond Meat and Impossible in plant-based foods, and several cell ag companies in seafood, meat, and materials, but most companies will either:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Fold.</strong> There will be increasing competition throughout the sector, and marginal players with inadequate management, poor IP, poor execution, or thin balance sheets will likely go bust. This is the way of the capitalist world and is a reason why investors should be diversified, do deep homework or place their investments in the sector with experienced teams.</li>
	<li> <strong>Sold.</strong> Many existing food companies or materials companies will want to, and indeed in some cases are actively doing so, get in on the revolution that is underway. They will open their cheque books, and in my opinion, most of the good quality companies (see my ratings for this) will be bought in the next five years or so. This is where exceptional returns can be made.  </li>
	<li><strong>Bold.</strong> Companies that are daring enough not to sell out, with the vision to build brands and distribution and raise significant sums, are likely to grow into large enterprises in their own right. Beyond is a good example, but likely JUST, Mosa Meat, BlueNalu, Memphis Meats, Meatable and VitroLabs will be in this category, along with some others. This requires bold entrepreneurship and high-quality backers.  </li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s move on to the BEST company list – based on my opinion and the opinion of my colleagues and experts I have spoken to. It is a list of those companies that represent the crème de la crème of the industry. Think of this as a fantasy football team of what an IDEAL portfolio of New Agrarian Revolution companies looks like.</p>

<p>These companies are also selected as the ones most likely to IPO in the near future, and therefore could be viable stock picks in the years to come. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), is currently the only publicly available company on this list, but there is no reason why Impossible Foods, The Meatless Farm, The Not Company or the LIVEKINDLY Collective, could not shoot for an IPO in the next couple of years.</p>

She described the experience of eating lab-grown duck from a startup I’d never heard of in an industry I didn’t know existed. That startup was Memphis Meats and I fell down the rabbit hole of cultivated meat. At the time I thought, and now am firmly convinced, that this technology will change the world.</p>

<p>I started the <a href=""https://bravenewmeat.buzzsprout.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>Brave New Meat</em></a> podcast to tell the stories of entrepreneurs and investors trailblazing this new frontier. As of this writing, I’m eleven episodes in, and I’ve never seen such a passionate cohort. These founders are motivated by and rooted in their personal, moral convictions to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>Additionally, through these conversations patterns have emerged about the present state and future of the cultivated meat industry. Although I’m sure my thoughts will continue to evolve, here are some of my current observations relevant to startups in the space.</p>

<h2><strong>Decentralization Out of the Valley</strong></h2>

<p>While many of the early American cultivated meat companies followed the tradition of software tech by starting in northern California (e.g., Memphis Meats, New Age Meats, Finless Foods), this trend seems to have less influence on more recent entrants.</p>

<p>Cultured Decadence, for instance, is developing cell-based crustacean meat. Both of the startup’s founders are Bay Area cultivated meat veterans, but opted to start their company in Madison, Wisconsin. <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/john-pattison-ian-johnson-co-founders-cultured-decadence/id1531974488?i=1000503515147"" target=""_blank"">John Pattison, CEO and co-founder said</a>, “When we were looking at different locations to base the company, we did an in-depth analysis of an ideal environment and ecosystem to start a company and successfully grow and scale that business.” They had three major criteria: 1) local biotech talent pipeline; 2) potential partners in food and biotech; 3) environment to efficiently deploy investor capital. Madison delivered on all three and the team is now operating out of <a href=""https://www.forwardbiolabs.org/"" target=""_blank"">Forward Biolabs</a>, a co-working life science lab for startups.</p>

<p>Farther south in North Carolina, Mariliis Holm and Ryan Bethencourt launched their VC fund, <a href=""https://www.sustainablefoodventures.com/"" target=""_blank"">Sustainable Food Ventures</a>, in 2020. They are also veterans of the Bay Area biotech industry, but decided to relocate to the Southeast. When Mariliis was on the <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mariliis-holm-co-founder-sustainable-food-ventures/id1531974488?i=1000499324829"" target=""_blank"">podcast</a>, she highlighted the advantages of North Carolina’s <a href=""https://www.rtp.org/"" target=""_blank"">Research Triange Park</a> (RTP), which leads the nation in affordability of the four major biotech research hubs (San Francisco, San Diego, and Boston). She went on to say, “RTP is such an interesting place … it has a lot to offer as an ecosystem.” As a biotech hub, in addition to affordability there is a plethora of local talent in large companies, but not a lot of startup activity relative to the other hubs. However, several of SFVs portfolio companies have recognized the opportunity and plan to relocate to Research Triangle in the future. North Carolina seems to be an increasingly attractive potential home for entrepreneurs looking to launch their cultivated meat startup.</p>

<p>Going forward into 2021, this decentralization will likely be accelerated by the broader trend seen during COVID-19, with teams more distributed and companies abandoning the pressure and and high costs of living and operating in the Bay Area and other expensive cities. Employees value quality of life, space, and affordability. Cultivated meat startups were already ahead of this curve, and there doesn’t seem to be a compelling case to reverse course.</p>

<h2><strong>Singapore Shining</strong></h2>

<p>Even before Eat Just received regulatory approval and launched their product at the <a href=""https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lab-grown-meat-debut-1880-robertson-quay-eat-just-13782904"" target=""_blank"">Singapore restaurant 1880</a>, Singapore was already a major player in the cultivated meat space. In addition to being the home of Shiok Meats and Turtle Tree Labs, which have raised <a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shiok-meats"" target=""_blank"">US$20 million</a> and <a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/turtletree-labs"" target=""_blank"">US$9.4 million</a>, respectively, the government launched a US$21 million “<a href=""https://agfundernews.com/as-supply-chains-feel-the-strain-singapore-launches-21m-30x30-express-grant.html"" target=""_blank"">30x30Express</a>” grant program to boost local food production technologies. Singapore is especially conscious of supply chains as it imports 90% of its food.</p>

<p>Singapore has come up in almost every podcast episode interview as an early adopter country. In my <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lisa-feria-ceo-stray-dog-capital/id1531974488?i=1000499945381"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Lisa Feria of Stray Dog Capital, she expanded on the Singapore government’s active engagement with cultivated meat startups her firm has invested in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Singapore as a country has been very opening and inviting and wants to partner with cultivated meat companies … Our existing portfolio companies, almost all of them, are talking to the Singapore government to have Singapore to be among the first places they produce. — Lisa Feria, Stray Dog Capital</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Contrarian View</h2>

<p>I often ask guests what contrarian view they have of the industry. Here’s mine — I believe regulatory showstoppers are overstated compared to technical challenges in scaling these products at an affordable price. Whenever the subject of the biggest challenge comes up, many tend to mention regulatory concerns first, technical challenges second. However, as illustrated by Singapore’s approval, there are governments that recognize the need to promote this technology and ensure food security.</p>

<p>In Israel, a story similar to the one in Singapore is unfolding. Aleph Farm’s made <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/blog-cultivated-meat-tasting-israel"" target=""_blank"">history</a> in December of 2020 when they served Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cultivated steak, making him the first head of state to taste a cultivated meat product. Not only did he enjoy the experience, he is actively supporting growing the industry in Israel.</p>

<p>Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute, <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/israels_prime_minister_tastes_cultivated_steak"" target=""_blank"">noted this occasion by saying</a>, “The Israeli government has turned the country into a nerve center for plant-based and cultivated meat innovation.” GFI works in both Israel and the US to <a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/412388-how-the-united-states-can-remain-a-world-leader-in-agriculture"" target=""_blank"">advance regulatory approval</a> of cultivated meat and the US doesn’t appear to be far behind. GFI’s efforts, coupled with the rest of the industry, <a href=""https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/03/07/usda-and-fda-announce-formal-agreement-regulate-cell-cultured-food"" target=""_blank"">led to a framework in 2019</a> by the USDA and FDA for regulating the sector.</p>

<p>However, the technical costs of bringing down cultivated meat prices remains a challenge, as evidenced by startups whose initial strategy was to vertically integrate and build in-house but have pivoted to specialize in critical components of the supply chain. As Lejjy Gafour, CEO of <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jalene-matt-anderson-baron-lejjy-gafour-co-founders/id1531974488?i=1000500624665"" target=""_blank"">Future Fields explained to me</a>, “We started as a consumer facing company with the hardest goal possible — to make chicken, which is the cheapest meat, using these techniques.” They have since pivoted to a B2B strategy developing growth media for companies making the cultivated meat products.</p>

<p>But with challenge comes opportunity and the B2B strategy seems to be the most viable, especially for new entrants seeking to avoid competition against multiple well funded teams with a several year head-start on beef and pork products, such as Mosa Meats, Aleph, Super Meat, and New Age Meats.</p>

<h2><strong>Initial Belief I’ve Changed — Winner Take All</strong></h2>

<p>When I started the podcast, I assumed one winner would emerge as essentially the Google of cultivated meat. I now believe there are many niches to fill throughout the supply chain from ingredients and components to end-consumer products.</p>

<p>On the B2B side, different meat products obviously require cell lines of different species, but that’s merely the tip of the iceberg. There are numerous approaches to scaffolding and bioreactor design with requirements that vary species to species. Similarly, there are different requirements for culture media between species. Many of the current supply chain solutions are focused on beef, pork, and chicken, but fish and crustaceans will require unique inputs.</p>

<p>For end-consumer products there is a huge opportunity for geographical differentiation. Although several companies are well capitalized with maturing products, they are located in only a handful of countries. However, most countries will be incentivized to follow the lead of Singapore and Israel to develop their own production capability for food security. Mariliis Holm described a future in which countries would strive “to be to be self-sufficient in terms of food supply … and a cuisine, cultural, and location-based production and food system.” Cultivated meat technology promises to give an incredible variety of products to countries and regions that historically have relied on imports to feed their populations.</p>

<p>While the future is far from clear, it is dynamic and exciting. One would be hard pressed to find an industry that will have more positive impact in our lifetime. The educational resources and networking opportunities provided by <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/resources.php?audience-page=entrepreneurs"" target=""_blank"">GFI </a>and <a href=""https://new-harvest.org/what-is-cellular-agriculture/"" target=""_blank"">New Harvest</a> are valuable tools for those seeking to launch a startup or career in cultivated meat.</p>",8217,"Image by alphaspirit.it/Shutterstock.com",

<p>Price parity for cultivated beef to compete with factory farming is an aspiration for the future of the industry. Many entrants expect cultivated meat to go to market at a price premium and target early adoption by consumers who value the social impact and health benefits of the product. In December of 2020, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/singapore-restaurant-first-ever-to-serve-eat-just-lab-grown-chicken.html"">Eat Just’s</a> chicken nuggets, the first cultivated meat product ever sold, were priced at US$23 per order in a Singapore restaurant.</p>

<p>Pricey, but the cost to produce cultivated meat is falling rapidly. In 2013, Mark Post famously produced the first cultivated burger for approximately $300,000. Since then, the cost has dropped by 6,000 times and now stands at around $50 per serving. As <a href=""https://rshigeta.medium.com/lab-grown-meat-is-scaling-like-the-internet-540893cbaf57"">described</a> by biotech investor and entrepreneur Ron Shigeta, this cost reduction is happening at a faster rate than both Moore’s law for transistor/software technology and human genome mapping.</p>

<p>Factory farmed beef historic trends, as described in year-over-year inflation adjusted retail beef prices by the team at <a href=""https://medium.com/@wild_type/wild-type-food-for-thought-67c3448f3129"">Wildtype</a>, show increasing prices since efficiencies and economies of scale reached their peak in the late 1990’s. More recently during Covid-19, shocks to the supply chain have caused <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/25/meatpackers-prices-coronavirus-antitrust-275093"">massive changes in prices</a> for beef consumers. Coupled with the fact the industry isn’t nimble enough to turn supply up or down — cattle take up to two years from birth to slaughter — legacy beef is vulnerable to a competitively priced substitute.</p>

<p>Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have already <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2020/01/17/beyond-meat-is-the-biggest-beneficiary-in-the-growing-plant-based-meat-market-study/?sh=34db95dd1a53"">demonstrated</a> consumers are willing to consider different plant-based options for their burgers. McDonald’s has recognized the trend, and is in the process of rolling out the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/business/mcdonalds-chicken-sandwich-delivery/index.html"">McPlant</a> burger line. However, despite the success of these products, they have been unable to significantly curtail the demand for traditional ground beef.</p>

<p>Enter the cultivated burger. As a true muscle and fat composition product, cultivated ground beef will have an opportunity to build on the momentum of changing consumer preferences and capture holdouts who haven’t hopped on the plant-based bandwagon. The industry expectation is that cultivated meat will appeal to consumers for the quality, animal welfare considerations, environmental impact, and health advantages of these new products.</p>

<p>Retailers and wholesalers will likely be affected by this entry, inducing a ripple effect across the supply chain for all factory-farmed beef products. Ground beef accounts for 21% of beef revenue for wholesalers and 25% for retailers. To maintain margins on these revenues, a long-term decrease in demand for ground beef would result in price increases for the major structured cuts — round, chuck, ribeye, and loin roasts/steaks. If cultivated ground beef is successful, this impact will likely be felt well before a cultivated steak is ever on the menu.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a simplified “one-cow” world of a single wholesaler selling one cow carcass to one grocery retailer. The current expected marginal revenue for the grocery store is approximately $1,375. Breaking this down by cut, ground beef accounts for nearly 40% of the meat by weight and 28% of the marginal<em> </em>revenue for the grocer.</p>

<p>Note some assumptions of this scenario are that consumers choose cultivated over legacy ground beef in a one-to-one switch, and the ground beef price is not reduced to maintain market share. Although a simplification, ground beef has the smallest margin of any beef product and can’t be reduced below about $2 before it is sold at a loss. There are methods to add fillers and non-cuts of meat to lower the cost, but this will also result in a reduction of quality, further eroding the value proposition to consumers.</p>

<p>This shift in preference will result in gradual price increases of other major cuts of beef in the one-cow example. Achieving 20% market share for cultivated ground beef would drive a 3% increase in prices for factory farmed steaks. Over time, consumers could see a massive 16% increase in the price of steaks. This is additive to price increases previously described by Wildtype due to supply chain issues and overall costs of legacy factory farming for beef.</p>

<p>Although it’s unclear if and when cultivated meat will break the business model for factory farming, it has a clear advantage as a technology that can meter supply on the order of weeks instead of years and deliver a higher quality product against an incumbent with few response options. The beef industry cannot assume they will command a price advantage for long with their production costs increasing, cultivated meat prices continuing to decrease, and consumers weighing in on their quest for a better burger.</p>",8173,"Illustration by Peter Hermes Furian/Shutterstock.com",

<p>The grant recipient, Lisa Musgrove, will be using the funds to investigate crayfish growth factors and cell culture during her Honours degree in 2021, under the supervision of USC GeneCology Research Centre scientist, Dr. Tomer Ventura. Musgrove will be the first Australian to receive a grant from New Harvest, one of the only sources for funding academic research in cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal agriculture. The emerging research field of cellular agriculture is dedicated to developing animal products (such as meat, eggs, and dairy) directly from cells rather than living animals. This novel food production method is projected to be more sustainable than conventional animal agriculture by decreasing the amount of land, raw materials, and energy required to produce meat.</p>
<p>There are currently ten cellular agriculture companies around the world focusing on developing cell-based seafood. “Compared to many land-based species, there is a relative lack of crustacean-related data, and there are no published crustacean cell lines. We’re aiming to address this shortfall,” says Musgrove.</p>
<p>Their research project will focus on the regenerating limb buds of Redclaw crayfish, a freshwater crayfish native to parts of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Redclaws are marketed as a premium seafood product and are known for their sweet, delicate flavor and high meat yield.</p>
<p>“The ultimate goal will be to find the factors and protocols needed to make the cells proliferate and differentiate into muscle, potentially leading to a myogenic crustacean cell line.” says Musgrove. Musgrove and Dr. Ventura believe the limb buds represent a unique opportunity to characterize the growth factors involved in muscle development and also to source muscle stem cells for sustainable meat production.</p>

<hr />
<p>A culture medium is a substance containing all the essential nutrients like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, salts, and vitamins that a cell needs to grow.</p>

<p>As the culture medium diffuses into the cell, the cell will grow, divide, and the cell line will proliferate.</p>

<p>Culture medium is an instrumental part of cellular agriculture and generating cultured tissue because it’s effectively what allows us to take a relatively small sample of animal stem cells and end up with enough to constitute an entire cut of meat. These stem cells are allowed to grow in a bioreactor containing culture medium where they are exposed to a range of environmental cues that encourage them to differentiate into the specialized kinds of cells we get in meat.</p>

<p>In order to supply all the essential nutrients to the cell, the culture medium usually consists of a basal mixture supplemented with extra growth factors.</p>

<p>Generally, these growth factors are what complicate things. Particularly with mammalian cells, when their tissue is grown <em>in vivo</em> (in the body), these growth factors are supplied by their own blood.</p>

<p>And so, in order to try to replicate this, cellular agriculture has for a while leveraged a supplement called fetal bovine serum (FBS) which, as it sounds, is the blood of a cow fetus. The two issues with this are that a) it is reliant on animals, hence defeating one of the primary goals of cellular agriculture, and b) it is expensive because it is so inaccessible.</p>

<p>There is currently no other substance that we can easily obtain that can single-handedly provide all these growth factors, so we turn to making them all individually using recombinant protein production. This works by inserting the DNA coding for whatever protein we want into a living organism (like yeast or bacteria) and feeding it sugar so that it makes copies of this DNA. But, at the moment, this too is expensive.</p>

<p>This naturally leads us to one of the biggest challenges facing cellular agriculture: finding the ideal culture medium that is simple, can stimulate proliferation, is unreliant on animals, is accessible, and is cheap.</p>

<p>Essential 8 is a culture medium that came about by refining the TeSR culture medium, which contained 19 ingredients, and cutting it down to the eight that were deemed “essential” for cell growth. It is a serum-free culture medium (i.e., doesn’t contain animal byproducts) which has been used to grow numerous kinds of cells from many different species.</p>

<p>It also only costs $376.80 per liter. But since culturing a burger, for instance, will require more than one liter of culture medium, this puts our starting cost for a burger product at well over $400. Needless to say, this would not be able to compete with current meat products.</p>

<p>But still, Essential 8 remains a relatively good starting point for trying to create a culture medium that meets all the above criteria. The Good Food Institute recently released a report entitled <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf"" target=""_blank""><em>An analysis of culture medium costs and production volumes for cultivated meat</em></a> in which they explored seven realistic ways to reduce the cost of the Essential 8 medium enough for it to be able to produce cost-competitive meat products. Here, we’re going to go over what those scenarios entail.</p>

<p>The points of these solutions are to be realistic — meaning they can be done with out some sort of major technological advancement — and also based on conservative estimates — meaning costs could likely be reduced even further.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Essential 8 this expensive?</strong></p>

<p>As we saw above, Essential 8 is made up of eight ingredients. They are,</p>

<p>Essential 8 = DMEM + Ascorbic Acid 2-phosphate (AA2P) + NaHCO_3 + Sodium Selenite + Insulin + Transferrin + FGF-2 + TGF-beta</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>DMEM:</strong> 52 ingredient basal medium which comprises the bulk of the culture medium and supplies most of the nutrients</li>
	<li><strong>AA2P:</strong> Vitamin C derivative</li>
	<li><strong>NaHCO_3 <span class=""amp"">&amp;</span> Sodium Selenite:</strong> Salts</li>
	<li><strong>Insulin + Transferrin + FGF-2 + TGF-beta:</strong> Growth Factors</li>

<p>As we can see:</p>

<ul>
	<li>99% of the cost comes from the growth factors and 96% come from FGF-2 and TGF-beta alone.</li>
	<li>97% of the remaining cost comes from the basal media, particularly because of the heavy reliance on an ingredient called HEPES which is a pH buffer (rebalances the pH in the presence of metabolites).</li>
	<li>AA2P is the next most costly contribution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What changes can be made?</strong></p>

<p>If we want to decrease the cost of the culture medium, we should start by trying to cut the cost associated with the growth factors, HEPES and AA2P. This can be done either by reducing the amount they are present in the media, sourcing them at a lower cost, or replacing them with a cheaper alternative.</p>

  </figure>

<p><strong>Scenario A: Divide all growth factor concentrations by 10</strong></p>

<p>The first solution is to just significantly reduce the amount of growth factors. At first this might seem counterproductive — <em>won’t this just hinder cell growth?</em> But in fact it can be done by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adapting the cell line over a few generations to tolerate lower concentrations</li>
	<li>Engineering the growth factors to be more stable. Typically, growth factors are meant to be “short term signals”, so they degrade quickly. By enabling them to last longer, we’ll need fewer of them.</li>
	<li>Engineering the growth factors to be more potent — i.e., more readily able to bind to the cells.</li>
	<li>Introducing cheaper “molecule mimics,” which are similar to the growth factors they are meant to replace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing this will bring the cost down to <strong>$40.94 </strong>per liter.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario B: Produce FGF-2 and TGF-beta at larger scales</strong></p>

<p>Right now, insulin and transferrin are produced much more cheaply than FGF-2 and TGF-beta, in part because they are produced at a much larger scale.</p>

<p>If we scale up production of FGF-2 and TGF-beta so their costs per gram are equivalent to those of insulin and transferrin, costs could fall to $800 and $16 per 20,000 liters, respectively. This would put the overall culture medium cost at <strong>$14.54</strong> per liter.</p>

<p>Now, this may seem a bit too simple. But scientifically, scaling up production should be entirely feasible since FGF-2 and TGF-beta are molecularly less complex than insulin and transferrin. However, producing these growth factors at this scale would necessitate an initial investment in equipment and facilities, as well the demand to make such investments practical.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario C: Scenario A + Scenario B</strong></p>

<p>Scenario A and Scenario B deal with two separate aspects of the culture medium. In this way, combining them shouldn’t lead to any sort of conflict (i.e., encouraging one shouldn’t hinder the other). It’s also possible that the two will work synergistically (improvements on one front will lead to even more improvement on the other front), but that wasn’t assumed in calculating the cost.</p>

<p>The total cost per liter would be <strong>$4.71</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario D: Produce all growth factors at $4/gram</strong></p>

<p>This would require us to produce the growth factors on an industrial scale equivalent to the way we currently produce enzymes such as lipase, cellulase, and amylase. Again, this is scientifically feasible given that our growth factors are molecularly simpler than enzymes. But as in Scenario B, a higher demand and considerable initial investment would be needed to reach those economies of scale.</p>

<p>This estimate is actually quite conservative considering that we do produce many enzymes at a rate of 10 cents per gram, and so we might even be able to produce several times more growth factors for this cost. This brings the cost down to <strong>$3.74 </strong>per liter.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario E: Scenario D + buying DMEM components at bulk food grade prices</strong></p>

<p>Currently, the components of the basal medium are bought at a pharmaceutical grade. The cheaper alternative would be to buy them at food grade.</p>

<p>In general, the concern with food grade as opposed to pharmaceutical grade is that there are more impurities which could contaminate our cell lines. However, with these specific ingredients, the food grade purity can be almost equal to the pharmaceutical grade purity, which is often higher than 99% in both cases and would still be considered acceptable.</p>

<p>This would make DMEM’s price fall to $4600 per 20,000 liters and the overall medium cost <strong>$0.85</strong> per liter.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario F: Scenario E + replace AA2P with food grade ascorbic acid</strong></p>

<p>AA2P is a long acting vitamin C derivative often used in cell cultures. Food grade ascorbic acid degrades faster than ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. However, its relative cost benefits still outweigh its functionality deficits. For instance, if 10 times as much ascorbic acid would be needed to achieve the same effects as AA2P, the overall cost would still be 99.6% less.</p>

<p>This brings the cost of the ascorbic acid component down to $4.48 per 20,000 liters and the medium cost to <strong>$0.35</strong> per liter.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario G: Scenario F + replace HEPES with TES</strong></p>

<p>TES is a pH buffer with a similar pH range, solubility, and pK_a to HEPES, but it only costs half as much.</p>

<p>There is also the argument that we might not even need to rely so heavily on HEPES in the first place because it is most effective for cultures where the cells are frequently taken out of their CO_2 supplemented conditions or when metabolites accumulate. This is not likely in the kinds of closed culture, continuous perfusion/filtration cultures we’re considering for meat, and so we might be able to deduct even more of the cost.</p>

<p>Now the cost of the DMEM component is $2,456 per 20,000 liters and the overall cost of the culture medium is <strong>$0.24 </strong>per liter—a lot less than Essential 8’s $377!</p>

  </figure>

<p><strong>Other possibilities</strong></p>

<p>Another minor measure which might help decrease the price is just reducing the number of ingredients involved in DMEM to the essential amino acids which can not be independently produced by a cell. But because this might stress the cells and hinder their growth, its cost benefits would have to be weighed against the productivity tradeoff.</p>

<p>The other possibility is to eliminate ingredients which are impractical for a specific set up. For instance, DMEM contains phenol red — a colorimetric pH indicator which changes colour based on the pH. However, if the bioreactor uses remote pH monitors, this addition would be redundant and so we can save more on the cost by getting rid of it.</p>

<p><strong>How much would meat production cost?</strong></p>

<p>Now comes the question of how much producing a specific amount of meat — let’s say a kilogram — would actually cost. This depends on how much culture medium those cells require and how much the culture medium costs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Number of cells per bioreactor</strong></p>

<p>The growth configuration we’re going to be focusing on is the batch process. This entails cells being grown in batches which are all harvested for use at once. This is different (and less efficient) than the continuous or semi-continuous process which is more of a perpetual letting cells grow and collecting them. The reason we’re going with the less efficient process is to ensure our estimates are not optimistic.</p>

<p>We’ll consider a 20,000-liter bioreactor which is near the upper bound in terms of size feasibility. While bigger bioreactors definitely exist, animal cells aren’t typically able to withstand the amount of pressure present in those models.</p>

<p>Cells proliferate best in what is called a <em>seed train bioreactor</em>, so we’ll start them off here. Once we want them to differentiate and structure onto the scaffold, we’ll put them into a <em>perfusion bioreactor</em>.</p>

<p>In a seed train bioreactor, minimum cell density requirements are considered to be 200,000 cells/ml — anything much lower will trigger cell apoptosis. Maximum cell density is 4 x 10⁷ cells/mL. So, in the proliferation stage, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Start the cells at minimum density</li>
	<li>Have them proliferate until they reach maximum density</li>
	<li>Put them into a larger bioreactor at minimum density</li>
	<li>Repeat until we get to a bioreactor of 20,000 L.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanding the culture from the minimum to the maximum density will take a 200 fold increase. Since we want to start our cells from a small frozen vile, we’ll have our largest seed train bioreactor be 20,000 L, the middle one be 100 L, and the smallest be 0.5 L, which can be filled from a 2.5 mL frozen tube.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Amount of time needed</strong></p>

<p>Expanding the culture from the minimum to the maximum density will take a 200-fold increase, which is just under eight doublings. According to Accelta, a 50- to 100-fold increase takes about seven days, so doubling time is calculated to be 28 hours, making our total eight periods 9.3—or about 10 days.</p>

<p>Since we have three of these seed train bioreactor phases to go through, this puts the process at about 30 days.</p>

<p>After, we want to seed our cells onto a scaffold so they can mature in a certain configuration. This takes an additional 10 days, bringing the total time to 40 days.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Total yield per batch</strong></p>

<p>We’re going to consider the average cell volume to be 5,000 micrometers³ per cell (this is a rough estimate as different kinds of cells in different species will be larger or smaller). A cubic meter of ground meat weighs about 881 kg, which includes some fat.</p>

<p>This puts our total yield at:</p>

<p>yield = (density of meat) x (unit conversion) x (avg. volume per cell) x (cell density) x (size of largest reactor)</p>

<p>= (881 kg/m³) x (10^-18 um/m³) x (5 x 10³ um/cell) x (4 x 10⁷ cells/ml) x (2x10⁷ ml/batch)</p>

<p>= 3,524 kg.</p>

<p>Now, this all has to be put into the perfusion bioreactor for differentiation. So, we’ll round up to 4,000 kg and double it to account for the necessary “void space” in and around the cells. This puts our bioreactor’s spatial requirements at about 8,000 L.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Required amount of culture medium</strong></p>

<p>Now we’re going to calculate a couple different possibilities for how much culture medium we require.</p>

<p>The minimum amount we require is enough to fill the largest bioreactor, which is 20,000 L. This assumes that the culture medium is never replaced.</p>

<p>The maximum amount we require is if we change the culture medium every 2 days which amounts to 5 medium changes for each phase, or:</p>

<p>0.5 * 5 + 100 * 5 + 20,000 * 5 + 8000 * 5 = 140,000 L</p>

<p>Then, we can take the average medium requirement, which is halfway between these two bounds, at 80,000 L.</p>

<p>Using this, we can figure out the cost per kg of meat for each of the media uses under each scenario. Scenario G, low media use, is <strong>$1.37</strong> per kg. Just to put this in context, the average production cost for a kilogram of ground beef is $7.62 USD.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions and oversimplifications</strong></p>

<p>Now, there are a whole bunch of assumptions and oversimplifications that we’ve made throughout this exercise. While the assumptions can all be justified, the main oversimplifications we made that would lead to some discrepancy with the actual final result are that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some cells will die and senesce</li>
	<li>Some cells that will not adhere to the scaffold, and so will not be part of the finished product</li>
	<li>Some cells won’t differentiate into muscle cells</li>
	<li>We need to use different growth factors for different cell lines</li>
	<li>Medium cost takes into account labor and preparation, not only the raw ingredients</li>
	<li>High cell density requires different medium conditions as low cell density</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, these prices don’t take into account the other raw costs that would go into production such as labor and energy required to power the bioreactor. Additionally, while the estimates were conservative and technically realistic, they would still require some major preliminary investments in order to get them started.</p>

<p>But, still, in light of these potential concerns, it is indisputable that generating a kilogram of meat for less than 2 dollars is better than just under 400. The author of the Good Food Institute’s study maintained that the results were optimistic and suggest that “it is likely that cultivated meat is capable of ultimately being cost-competitive with conventional meat production at scale”.</p>",7569,"Essential 8™ Medium.

<hr />
<p>You may have heard of cellular agriculture — the science of growing animal products without the animal<em>. </em>In recent years, it has emerged as an interesting idea for producing alternative proteins.</p>

<p>The main motivation for this technology is that it has the potential to decrease the negative effects of food production on the environment (e.g., intensive resource use, emissions, antibiotics, animal cruelty, etc.) while still allowing people to eat all the things they want to eat.</p>

<p>If you live in a Western culture, this generally means things like beef, pork, chicken, and some seafood.</p>

<p>But what about things outside of the Western meat bubble — what about insects? In many places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, insects are already familiar ingredients. Think Korean beondegi, Ugandan nsenene, or Mexican escamole.</p>

<p>Insects, after all, have been shown to be much easier to culture than mammalian cells, which is what has prompted scientists to seriously consider entomoculture — cellular agriculture specifically for insects.</p>

<p>For many, this might stir up images of consuming whole crickets and the likes of which, while common in many cultures, could be hard for some to stomach.</p>

<p>But entomoculture is not about growing an entire cricket, for instance. It’s only really about growing the cricket meat — not any of the crunchy cartilage that makes up the majority of the insect. Just like when we farm a cow, we don’t plop the entire animal hide, bones and all on a plate, but instead focus only on the parts we want to eat.</p>

<p>What’s more, this meat can be grown and structured to look like a large piece such as a steak, burger, pork loin, chicken leg, or any of the other cuts of meat we are currently familiar with.</p>

<p>In other words, entomoculture products might not look anything like our current conception of what it means to eat insects. In fact, they might end up being almost exactly like popular animal-based meat products eaten today.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Entomoculture Work?</strong></p>

<p>When we produce any kind of meat using cellular agriculture, we are said to be culturing it <em>in vitro</em>. This is done in <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952117305426?via%3Dihub"">four main steps</a>.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mesodermal cells with high expression of Twist and Sloppy-paired are extracted from the animals. Mesodermal stem cells are cells which have the potential to become any kind of specialized cell. Twist and Sloppy-paired are proteins which are responsible for turning them into muscle tissue. In the case of a primary culture, the cells are taken directly from the animal. In the case of secondary cultures, cells might be cryopreserved (frozen) from previous experiments.</li>
	<li>Stem cells are immersed in a culture medium and proliferate. A culture medium is a substance containing everything cells need to grow like carbohydrates, fats, amino acids, salts, and vitamins. As these molecules diffuse into the cells, they grow and eventually split into two smaller cells. In this way, our population of stem cells, now a mix of myoblasts and progenitors, increases exponentially, or “proliferates.”</li>
	<li>Stem cells are seeded onto a scaffold. Structured meat products are characterized not only by the kinds of cells present, but their overall arrangement as well (think steak vs. ground beef). A scaffold is a mold which the cells grow in and around to achieve this specific arrangement.</li>
	<li>Scaffold is put into a bioreactor for differentiation. Bioreactors are machines which expose the cells to a variety of different environmental cues — for instance, electrical stimulation and mechanical contractions. This encourages the cells to differentiate into the types of specialized cells we get in meat. These myoblasts then fuse to form multi nucleated myofibers — i.e., muscle tissue.</li>
</ol>

<p>How does this compare to mammalian cell cultures?</p>

<p>The specifics of each of these steps are best understood <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00024/full"">in relation to mammalian cells</a>, so let’s take a look at those.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Tolerance</strong></p>

<p>Overall, insect cells can withstand a much larger range of environmental conditions than mammalian cells.</p>

<p>When mammalian cells are grown <em>in vivo </em>(in the body), they are exposed to fairly hot conditions — about 37 degrees Celsius. In order to mimic these conditions, bioreactors have to be heated which requires more energy and drives up production costs. Insect cells, on the other hand, coming from non-warm-blooded creatures, can be grown to scale at room temperature.</p>

<p>As mammalian cells digest and metabolize glucose, they produce lactic acid and other byproducts. As they accumulate, they acidify the cell’s environment which leads to inferior growth conditions for the cell. Unless the environment is rebalanced, the cells will not grow as well. The rebalancing of the environment is usually done by replacing the entire culture medium — sometime as frequently as every 2–3 days. Needless to say, this wastes nutrients and is expensive.</p>

<p>Insect cells are more tolerant to different pH levels. When insect cell growth was compared at a pH of 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5, not much of a difference was noted. What’s more, insect cells partially circumvent the production of lactate as they don’t produce as much lactic acid to begin with.</p>

<p>As a result, insect cultures can get away with full media replacements as infrequently as each 90 days. Now, the other reason the media needs to be changed is because of nutrient depletion. However, insect cells don’t deplete added nutrients as quickly as mammalian cells. The first reason is because they consume triglycerides, glucose, and proteins at a slower rate suggesting that they have more efficient metabolic pathways.<strong> </strong>The other reason is that cell cultures are typically contaminated with lipid cells called trophocytes or vitellophages<strong> </strong>which are precursors to insect egg yolk cells. These cells are a natural source of fat which can be consumed by the other insect cells.</p>

<p>Mammalian cells also require a relatively precise measure of carbon dioxide and oxygen to grow — as such, cultures are usually supplemented with an extra 5% carbon dioxide. Insects can go without this supplement.</p>

<p><strong>Serum vs. Serum-Free Culture Medium</strong></p>

<p>A culture medium is a substance containing all the essential nutrients like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, salts, and vitamins which a cell needs to grow.</p>

<p>As the culture medium diffuses into the cell, the cell will grow, divide, and the cell line will proliferate.</p>

<p>Culture medium is an instrumental part of cellular agriculture and generating cultured tissue because it’s effectively what allows us to take a relatively small sample of animal stem cells and end up with enough to constitute an entire cut of meat. These stem cells would then be put into a bioreactor where they are exposed to a whole bunch of environmental cues which encourage them to differentiate into the specialized kinds of cells we get in meat.</p>

<p>But in order to proliferate, a cell does not only require essential nutrients and macromolecules. It also needs things called growth factors. When mammalian cells grow <em>in vivo</em> , these growth factors are supplied by the animal’s blood.</p>

<p>In order to replicate this, the culture medium usually consists of a basal mixture supplemented with extra growth factors. The basal medium makes up the bulk of the culture and contains most of the nutrients while the growth factors are added in trace amounts.</p>

<p>So now the question becomes, how do we get these growth factors? Since they all exist in perfect proportions in an animal’s blood stream, the natural starting point is mixing some mammalian blood into the medium — specifically something called Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS).</p>

<p>FBS is enormously controversial because, as it sounds, it comes from the blood of a dairy cow fetus. The two issues with this is that a) it is reliant on animals, hence defeating one of the primary goals of many cellular agriculture researchers, and b) it is expensive.</p>

<p>Additionally, from a scientific perspective, FBS is typically undefined<strong>, </strong>meaning that its chemical composition varies from animal to animal, which for research purposes isn’t desirable.</p>

<p>There is currently no other substance we can easily obtain that can single-handedly provide all these growth factors, so we turn to trying to make them each individually using recombinant protein technologies. But, at the moment, this too is expensive.</p>

<p>This naturally leads us to one of the biggest challenges for cellular agriculture: finding the ideal culture medium that is simple, can stimulate proliferation, is unreliant on animals, is accessible, and is cheap.</p>

<p>Because mammalian cells rely on a complex array of growth factors, finding a culture medium that satisfies all five of these criteria is an ongoing challenge.</p>

<p>Insect cells, on the other hand, come from insects which are biologically simpler organisms than mammals. They contain a fluid called <em>haemolymph</em><strong> </strong>rather than blood and so do not rely on all the same growth factors as mammalian cells.</p>

<p>This in large part allows us to get around the entire balancing act presented by serum. Instead, insect cell medium typically uses a basal medium (such as Eagle’s Medium, Grace’s Insect Medium, or Schneider’s Drosophila Medium) which is supplemented with plant-based additives.</p>

<p>Some examples of these plant based additives are things like</p>

<ul>
	<li>Yeastolate</li>
	<li>Primatone RL</li>
	<li>Hydrolysates</li>
	<li>Pluronic Lipids</li>
	<li>Peptides</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, due to insect cells’ limited reliance on growth factors in the first place (animal derived or otherwise), mediums are typically simpler in their chemical composition and are cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Adherent vs. Suspension Cultures</strong></p>

<p>When mammalian muscle cells grow <em>in vivo</em>, a fundamental part of their proliferation relies on their attachment to the e<em>xtracellular matrix </em>(ECM). In order to replicate this relationship, mammalian cells are usually cultured in <em>adherent monolayers </em>— cultures where the cells grow on something else in layers only one cell thick. This necessitates using bioreactors with a lot of surface area which, when scaled up to the industrial level, is infeasible.</p>

<p>The alternative would be using something called <em>microcarriers</em> — little bits of material that float around in the culture medium which the cells can attach to, increasing the overall available surface area. But this requires additional resources and more time to separate out from the meat at the end, complicating the process.</p>

<p>This also introduces the need to <em>vascularize</em>. When mammalian cells are grown in adherent cultures, the cells which are not in direct contact with culture medium will stop growing because they can’t access nutrients. So, the culture medium has to somehow be routed through the meat.</p>

<p>Unlike mammalian cells, insect cells are also able to grow unattached to anything — or in <em>suspension cultures</em>. This means that bioreactors don’t need to have a large surface area, and can instead be designed using much more practical shapes.</p>

<p>In terms of insect protein alternatives in general, a few companies like <a href=""https://gourmetgrubb.com/entomilk/"">Entomilk</a> and <a href=""https://eatchirps.com/"">Chirps</a> are already working on using crickets as a base for ice cream and protein powder, respectively.</p>

<p>But, at the moment, entomoculture is still mostly in the research phase. In particular, at Tufts University, PhD candidate and New Harvest research fellow Natalie Rubio is <a href=""https://www.new-harvest.org/current_research_projects"">working on</a> developing a three-dimensional culture system for insect tissue biofabrication.</p>

And Australia is well placed to become an international powerhouse for an emerging research field that could transform the way we produce and eat meat: cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>The cellular agriculture industry develops animal products – such as meat, eggs, and leather – without the need for conventional animal agriculture. The technology could have major implications for the environment, animal welfare, biodiversity, and human health.</p>
<p>So far, the US dominates the ""alternative protein"" space. But cellular agriculture has recently become a compelling opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors in Australia, thanks to our internationally renowned expertise in both the animal agriculture industry and the stem cell and biomaterials research sector.</p>
<p><strong>All hands on deck</strong></p>
<p>Like any emerging industry, cellular agriculture will create new markets, new applications, and new jobs – particularly for those with STEM skills. As the number of university graduates in STEM surpass the number of available jobs in Australia’s current economy [1], a new interdisciplinary field such as cellular agriculture would be a welcome opportunity for job seekers.</p>
<p>Developing cultivated meat has a number of scientific and technological challenges. But before cultivated meat products can be found on supermarket shelves or in restaurants, issues surrounding regulation and consumer acceptance remain to be resolved. A social license for cultivated meat that is specific to the Australian context is necessary for commercial viability. Policy makers, social scientists, and marketing experts with background knowledge of Australian regulatory frameworks and consumer behavior will be required to ensure cultivated meat is not subjected to the same criticisms - and ultimate downfall - as GMOs.</p>
<p>As with traditional livestock farms, future cultivated meat ""farms"" will also provide manufacturing jobs in large-scale cell cultivation and food processing, particularly in regional areas.</p>
<p>Since 2018, three cultured meat companies have been founded in Australia: <a href=""/directory/heuros"">Heuros</a>, <a href=""/directory/vow"">VOW</a>, and, more recently, <a href=""/directory/cass-materials"">Cass Materials</a>. Each company focuses on a different component of the cultivated meat puzzle: serum-free cell culture media, cell lines, and 3D scaffolds, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>So how does Australia compare to the international cellular agriculture industry? </strong></p>
<p>According to the <a href=""/directory/good-food-institute"">Good Food Institute</a>, a US-based multinational nonprofit organization, 22 companies working on developing cultivated meat or cellular agriculture technology (such as bioreactors or biosoftware) have been founded in the US alone since 2015. Israel and the UK tie for second place, each with five companies working in the sector since 2015 and 2016, respectively [2].</p>
<p>Fortunately, R&amp;D within the cellular agriculture industry has been rapidly expanding in Australia over the past two years, with several universities jumping in on this massive commercial opportunity.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://research.unimelb.edu.au/research-at-melbourne/multidisciplinary-research/hallmark-research-initiatives/future-food"">Future Food Hallmark Research Initiative</a> is a new research collaboration led by the University of Melbourne, spanning five faculties within the university as well as external research partners, government, and industry. The Initiative unites researchers in food policy and regulation, consumer insight, human health and nutrition, agriculture, food processing, chemistry, and engineering. This collaborative effort focuses on developing and producing sustainable, healthy, and affordable protein products, including plant-based meats and nutritious proteins derived from insects and algae.</p>
<p>In 2019, the initiative funded several research projects currently underway. A second round of seed funding for research projects in 2020-2021 will be announced later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Not if, but when</strong></p>
<p>The question of whether cellular agriculture will be a major player in Australia’s economy is not a matter of if, but when – and in what form. The global demand for protein is increasing significantly and traditional production will need to be supplemented by non-animal-based sources [3][4]. It’s no surprise, then, that the world's cultivated meat market is predicted to grow by US$200 million during 2020-2024 [5]. It’s clear Australia can be a leading producer and exporter of cellular agriculture technologies and high-quality cultivated meat products akin to Wagyu steaks and Australian grass-fed beef. Otherwise, we’ll rely too heavily on traditional animal agriculture, only to find ourselves in 10 years' time dependent on importing alternative protein products from international markets.</p>
<p>Farming and animal agriculture have been core to every culture around the world for thousands of years and will continue to be so. Cellular agriculture isn’t a replacement for that, but an addition to our existing agricultural sector and food industry.</p>
<p>If the goal is to secure the future of Australia’s agriculture industry, then the strategy must be to maximize economic benefits and minimize the ecological impacts of meat production, while also meeting growing consumer demand. Collaboration and coexistence between animal agriculture and cellular agriculture is one way to do that. Diversification into new protein markets will also allow Australia’s meat industry to maintain global competitiveness, encourage innovation, and future-proof our food systems. Cellular agriculture also provides alternatives to omnivores who are environmentally conscious or are concerned about animal welfare.</p>
<p>Australia has previously struggled with technological changes in energy, transport, and telecommunications. Just look at the A$2.2 billion blow-out of the National Broadband Network [5]. The good news is that the government is currently providing significant funding and legislative support for agtech and food-tech research, innovation, investment, and commercialization efforts. Let’s make sure we don’t fall behind in this agricultural revolution.</p>

<p>Perth-based <a href=""/directory/cass-materials"">Cass Materials</a> has harnessed the natural fermentation processes discovered in the production of nata de coco — a coconut jelly commonly used in desserts in the Philippines — to manufacture a nanocellulose fiber matrix within which meat cells can adhere and grow. These nanocellulose fibers are also produced in scoby, the symbiotic culture formed during the fermentation of kombucha and several other naturally fermented foods and beverages.</p>

<p>Founder Gary Cass says the scaffold is tasteless, so as not to taint the flavour of meat, and is a dietary fiber, which could improve the nutritional value of cultivated meat. “You can have your protein and dietary fiber in one bite!” says Cass.</p>

<p>Cellular agriculture is an evolving research field within the alternative protein space that could generate meat and other materials such as leather without the need for conventional animal agriculture. This technology could have significant potential implications for environmental sustainability, animal welfare, biodiversity, and human health. However, recreating meat cuts with complex structures, such as steak or chicken wings, requires the development of a 3D scaffold to support multiple cell types such as muscle, bone, skin and fat. The structural scaffold found in animal meat consists mainly of collagen fibers.</p>

<p>“The BNC scaffolds’ 3D fibrous matrix has similar physical dimensions to collagen (human structural proteins) and has shown to successfully scaffold animal cells in culture,” says Cass.</p>

<p>“Being at the forefront of this emerging technology will give Cass Materials the ability to supply a cost-effective and scalable scaffold to the cultivated meat industry, while satisfying the high priority objectives of lowering carbon emissions, utilising less water and less arable land,” Cass added.</p>

<p>While the goal for many cellular agriculture researchers is to optimize large-scale cultivated meat production in order to reach price parity with animal-farmed meat, Cass believes cultivated meat will enter the market as a premium product — and this could have a positive influence on conventional animal farming. Drawing parallels to the egg industry, Cass explains: “Once we realized what was happening to the hens in these cages, it was no longer acceptable for our society. People are increasingly willing to pay more for free-range eggs, and we’ve seen a big movement in the industry overall toward more ethical practices.”</p>

Brussels-based startup <a href=""/directory/tiamat-sciences"">Tiamat Sciences</a> believes their technology platform could become the best option to bridge that gap.</p>

<p>The Tiamat team is developing a plant-based molecular farming technology to manufacture an affordable culture medium, growth factors, and other proteins that will enable cell-based meats to become cost-competitive, mainstream alternatives to their animal-based counterparts.</p>

<p>“Our unique technology allows exceptional flexibility with a production system costing up to 60-times less than that of our current competitors, and has greater potential to scale up to meet mass production requirements,” says Tiamat co-founder and CEO France-Emmanuelle Adil.</p>

<p>With cell culture media accounting for <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf"" target=""_blank"">up to 80%</a> of cell-based meat production costs, Tiamat believes their product is the answer many have been looking for.</p>

<p>How does Tiamat achieve such dramatically lower production costs for their media? By using plants instead of bioreactors to manufacture their proteins.</p>

<p><strong>The limits of current recombinant protein technologies</strong></p>

<p>Recombinant proteins are produced using a gene sequence in combination with an external system that will replicate and produce the desired protein. Several technologies are currently used to create various recombinant proteins from enzymes to antibodies to growth factors. In many cases, they are the best alternatives for removing animal-based products from biotechnology processes.</p>

<p>But currently, the two leading animal-free technologies rely on E. coli or yeast systems, both of which come with high production costs. This is mainly due to the expensive fermentation infrastructure (bioreactors), and the high energy consumption associated with culturing, cleaning, and sterilizing such installations. These technologies are also relatively inflexible as a cell line needs to be designed prior to production, and they come with potential risks of human pathogen contamination and the resulting challenges of handling contaminated waste.</p>

<p><strong>Plants as natural bioreactors</strong></p>

<p>Tiamat’s <em>PlanTech </em>technology utilizes plants to manufacture proteins that will be used to produce essential ingredients for clean meats. Using a tailored plant vector in combination with a pathogen, they infect natural plants that then grow their proteins. This temporary and local production is made possible by the plant’s natural transient expression ability. After a few days, the plants are harvested and the proteins are extracted and purified to obtain the final products.</p>

<p>Besides culture media, Tiamat plans to use this process to produce a range of growth factors, other ingredients for flavor and texture such as leghemoglobin, and even leaf-based scaffolding for cell-cultured meats.</p>

<p>In addition to their own production, Tiamat plans to offer “proteins as a service” by licensing out their technology and management of custom-tailored internal production facilities.

<p>Tiamat’s goal is to supply 50% of the market’s cell culture media by 2040, with the first profitable production facility launching in 2021. Between 2022 and 2024, the company plans to expand with a focus on the European and Asian markets.</p>

<p>In terms of production quantities, an average cell-based meat company is believed to use approximately <a href=""https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf"" target=""_blank"">140,000 liters</a> of media to produce 10,000 kilograms of meat. Tiamat estimates their first facility will contain 200,000 plants in an indoor vertical farm able to produce 5,250 liters of media per month to supply medium-scale cellular agriculture companies by 2024. By 2026, they hope to have 20 million plants producing 525,000 liters of media per month for medium and large-scale cellular agriculture companies. They will also rely on their low facility cost to open several new manufacturing centers close to future clients.</p>",7244,"From left, Tiamat Sciences co-founders France-Emmanuelle Adil and Clément Carlier.

Copyright © 2020 by Chase Purdy.</strong></p>

<p>On December 29, 2017, just two days before New Year’s Eve, Josh Tetrick, the CEO of JUST, and his golden retriever, Elie, boarded a nonstop KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight in San Francisco that would take him halfway around the world to Amsterdam, where he hoped to make the first commercial sale of cell-cultured meat.</p>

<p>The journey had monumental potential. For several weeks prior, he and a small team at JUST had toiled over every minute detail of the trip, an intense effort to maximize the chances this rarefied mission would be clocked as a success. They researched shipping rules and times and even designed a nutrition facts panel for the box in an attempt to be overtly transparent about what was inside.</p>

<p>There was just one complication. To Tetrick’s knowledge, no one had ever shipped cell-cultured meat across the world and into a totally separate consumer marketplace. Just how a package of cell-cultured meat would get through customs—if at all—remained a mystery. But it was imperative that it did. Tetrick was operating against a tight deadline.</p>

<p>On January 1, 2018, the European Union would implement an update to its 1997 novel foods legislation that would expand the definition of nontraditional foods to include products “originating from plants, animals, microorganisms, cell cultures, minerals, etc.” as well as those that were made using new and innovative production processes. Under these rules, a company such as JUST would have to fill out a formal application and submit to the government a request to have its cell-cultured duck chorizo considered, tested, and approved to be listed as a novel food. That update to the EU’s food policy was all fine, in Tetrick’s estimation. The issue was that the process would likely take up to two years for bureaucrats to complete once the company submitted an application. With that in mind, Tetrick wanted to make an effort to sell his product into the market before the new law took effect. If his cultured meat was sold before the new regulatory regime, he felt there would be a legal basis for the argument that JUST’s cell-cultured meat could be grandfathered into the food system. He’d still have to apply to sell a novel food, but as he understood it his cell-cultured product could be sold and consumed while the application was being processed. It was a long shot, but he was optimistic about his chances.</p>

<p>There are material aspects to making cell-cultured meat a reality—nailing the science, raising capital, pitching products to retailers and restaurants—and then there are more amorphous elements: building a good story around the technology.</p>

<p>For Tetrick, launching JUST’s cell-cultured meat in the Netherlands was a narrative gold mine. It was the birthplace of the concept, the nation has a history of progressive climate policies, and he owned Willem van Eelen’s patents.</p>

<p>He had roughly forty-eight hours to make that story work. The clock was ticking.</p>

<p>He arrived in the Netherlands at the end of a ten-and-a-half-hour trip that left him standing in Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport arrivals hall, waiting for his package to spit off the airliner and down a cargo carousel. Minutes passed—long, excruciating minutes. He waited. And waited. Once Tetrick realized he was the last person standing at the carousel, he dashed to a nearby customer service counter. Nightmare scenarios played out in his head, not least of all the possibility that two pounds of priceless cell-cultured meat had been plucked from the arriving cargo by a team of skeptical customs personnel.</p>

<p>As the minutes ticked by, Tetrick nervously prepared himself for a showdown with Dutch customs officials.</p>

<p>An airline representative checked one of the company systems on a computer.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Another representative checked a separate system, scrolling through lists of package identification information. A minute passed. Then another long minute.</p>

<p><em>How many systems can they possibly have?</em> Tetrick wondered.</p>

<p>One of the agents looked up.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks like it didn’t get off the ground in San Francisco,” he said.</p>

<p>It never left the United States. It was, in fact, still sitting more than 5,400 miles away, thanks to the airline’s own shipping error.</p>

<p>On one hand this was good news—the meat hadn’t disappeared into a Boschian customs nightmare. But the time line now felt impossible. Was there even a shred of a chance it could be shipped around the world in time to meet Tetrick’s January 1 deadline?</p>

<p>He pleaded with apologetic KLM representatives, who assured him the package had been located and would be on a flight to the Netherlands as soon as possible. In the meantime, he’d just have to wait. By then it was late afternoon on December 29. The package had approximately thirty-six hours to get from the United States to the Netherlands, through customs, and into his hands—all during the busy holiday season—if he hoped to make a sale before the new food law went into effect.</p>

<p>Tetrick had planned to stay with Ira van Eelen on her spacious houseboat. When the two met, their anxiety dampened any excitement about their shared, potentially historic moment. Both their fates were dependent on an international airline.</p>

<p>When he woke up the next morning, Ira was already up and preparing breakfast for her guest. She stood over a stove, sizzling up sausages and bacon from a local vegan butcher shop. The pair ate their meal in relative silence, munching on vegan “meat” while waiting for a delivery of higher-tech vegan meat.</p>

<p>Then there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>A courier handed over a box. <em>The</em> box. KLM hand-delivered the package, fresh off an overnight flight from San Francisco. And just like that, Tetrick had a little more than fifteen hours to make the historic sale. The box contained one package of ground duck chorizo and a single duck sausage link.</p>

<p>With the meat in hand, Tetrick and Ira piled into her van and drove north of Amsterdam and into Zaandam, a city along the North Sea canal and a major Dutch industrial hub. They were en route to a restaurant owned, in part, by a man named Paul Riteco.</p>

<p>Today Dutch tourism agencies market Zaandam as a place to see life in the Netherlands as it used to be. With its well-preserved wooden homes and, of course, the windmills, it’s a spot that draws tourists by the thousands every year. For that reason, Ira and Tetrick had envisioned it as the ideal location to introduce cell-cultured meat to the world—a convergence of old and new before the eyes of inquisitive global visitors.</p>

<p>“Millions and millions of tourists come here and we want to feed them JUST meat,” Ira told me.</p>

<p>Tetrick made the sale on December 31. Riteco bought a little more than a pound at the very-discounted price of $11 per pound. Riteco’s young daughter was present at the sale, hovering over the table next to her father, who’d brought her along in hopes of giving her a rare glimpse into what he hoped would be a big part of her future. Tetrick said he also intended to set up a miniature production facility so that the restaurant might produce its own meat to feed consumers.</p>

<p>A tiny amount of meat was also sold to the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, which was planning an exhibit around the concept. In video footage of the sale, Tetrick is sandwiched between Ira and the director of NEMO. To his left, Ira is quiet, rosy, and stifling tears. Tetrick notices, and asks her what her father would think if he were there to see it. She rocks back and forth and smiles, seemingly unable to get a word out.</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes,” she replies in a near whisper, this time unable to withhold her emotions.</p>

<p>For that moment, Tetrick had made history. On his return flight home, he basked in the glow of sidling up to the edge of history and taking a step forward into the unknown.</p>

<p>But what he didn’t know was that his victory would be extremely short-lived. The regulatory landscape in the EU is as fickle as—if not more so than—that in the United States.</p>

<p>And while much of the plant- and cell-based dairy industry is working to carve out its niche among the lactose-intolerant, environmentally conscious, or cruelty-free crowds, New York-based startup <a href=""/directory/helaina"" target=""_blank"">Helaina</a> is in the lab working to appease an even more discriminating consumer—babies. Or maybe more accurately, their parents.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>

<p>“Something most people don’t know is that 87% of babies are fed formula at some point,” says Laura Katz, Founder and CEO of Helaina. Katz (who is also an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University) worked in the food science industry for years and while she saw opportunity in the burgeoning alternative <a href=""/meat"" target=""_blank"">meat</a> and <a href=""/dairy"" target=""_blank"">dairy</a> categories, launching a start-up solely for the sake of making another alternative dairy product was not necessarily on her agenda. Instead, she was more interested in developing a solution to a different problem.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a vegetarian for 14 years and I’ve also always just been really interested in matters of women’s health,” Katz told <em>Protein Report</em>. Seeing an opportunity to pair her values with her work, Katz launched an extensive research process, speaking to as many mothers as she could to see where problems were arising and where she could help. One topic that kept coming up? The challenges of breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Medical professionals have touted the benefits of breast milk for decades and, if prompted, you could probably rattle them off in your head—improved immunity, decreased incidence of allergies, fewer middle ear infections, purportedly higher IQ. The mantra “breast is best” is one every pregnant woman has heard for decades. That’s where that 87% stat becomes important.</p>

<p>Because while most every woman is encouraged to breast-feed, it doesn’t mean every woman <em>can</em> exclusively provide nutrition in that way (nor may want to).</p>

<p>Barriers to breast-feeding are myriad and can range from the biological (not wanting to pass on infectious disease, a baby unable to breakdown certain amino acids or lactose) and the mechanical (past surgical interventions, a baby’s inability to properly latch) to the situational (ask any person who has had to discreetly duck out of a meeting at work to pump). To Katz, this represented an opportunity not to just to make feeding more convenient and accessible to the nursing parent, but more inclusive to the non-nursing partners, including trans or cisgender male parents.</p>

<p>Katz also recognized a particular need for her product in the United States, where parental leave policies are minimal and nursing parents too often bear the brunt of the nutritional workload. Formula has long served this role as a parental labor equalizer, yet as the sole alternative to breast milk, it rarely innovated except where regulators insisted the industry meet specific nutritional or protection benchmarks.</p>

<p><strong>Current Options</strong></p>

<p>Commercially made formulas have been available to parents since the late 19th Century but it wasn’t until targeted and intensive marketing to doctors and hospitals in the 1950s that formula began its ascendance. By the early 1970s, only 14% of two- to three-month-old infants were being breast-fed in the United States.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>But just as a post-WWII baby boom, the influx of women into the workforce, and a cultural love affair with science nudged those mid-century parents toward formula, current consumer culture now increasingly demands foods be as natural as possible. What “natural” means, of course, is largely consumer-driven and always evolving.</p>

<p>This is where Helaina and companies like it see a huge opportunity to disrupt the staid formula industry.</p>

<p><strong>The Methodology</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the advertising of the 50s and 60s, what Helaina is working on doesn’t position itself as a better alternative to breast milk. No matter how perfect a milk the lab can create, it can’t replicate a mother’s immunity or hormones that can be transferred during nursing. But what it can do potentially, is be a better alternative to the only other option parents have right now, offering more easily digested nutrition than formula, a composition much closer to breast milk itself, and introduce beneficial bacteria for a baby’s developing microbiome.</p>

<p>Helaina’s milk is developed using technology borrowed from food science. Using yeast, Helaina’s lab nurtures a fermentation process that results in a unique microflora that can express milk. According to Katz, rigorous procedural guidelines ensure consistent nutritional composition and quality.</p>

<p>Several other companies, including Singapore-based <a href=""/directory/turtletree-labs"" target=""_blank"">TurtleTree Labs</a> and North Carolina-based <a href=""/directory/biomilq"" target=""_blank"">Biomilq</a>, are also racing to develop breast milk for the consumer market. Unlike Helaina, these companies are utilizing cell-based technology (though Biomilq prefers the term “cultured breastmilk”). As with most start-ups, it can be difficult to glean specifics about their proprietary methodology, but we do know that TurtleTree Labs’ process begins with stem cells, which they then use to create human mammary cells which yield real breast milk. Biomilq’s process appears to be similar but their mammary cells are derived from commercially available lines.</p>

<p><strong>The Outlook</strong></p>

<p>Helaina declines to share a go-to-market date estimate but, as Katz acknowledged, they may have an advantage on other companies racing to develop breast milk because their product is fermented, a process regulators (including the FDA) already have established rules and guidelines for. In contrast, cell-based competitors will likely be slower to market as their techniques are coming not from the realm of food-science but medical-science, which presents many more regulatory hurdles.</p>

<p>Consumers will no doubt have to do a bit of conceptual gymnastics to understand just how quickly this sector of the food industry is growing. Instead of alternatives to dairy made with, for instance, soy or nuts, it’s harder to categorize exactly what you’d call Helaina’s product. Katz acknowledges her company (and the larger alternative dairy industry as a whole) may have to do some heavy lifting when it comes to consumer education. And while the company refers to its product as “fermented milk” there’s no doubt it’s real milk. It’s just that with no humans or animals as its source, it may be time for our vocabulary about these products to catch up with the products themselves.</p>

This is something we can fix.</p>

<p>Here’s the sadder truth: For America’s modern dairy industry, milk dumping is a common practice — pandemic or not. Several years back, American dairy farmers <strong>discarded 43 million gallons of milk in the first 8 months</strong> of the calendar year alone. This is all because the industry absurdly keeps making milk no one wants to buy…and the government pays them to do it. Or, they buy it and turn it into cheese. At the start of 2019, the U.S. reached a record high milk surplus, resulting in <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683339929/nobody-is-moving-our-cheese-american-surplus-reaches-record-high"">1.4 billion pounds</a> of unwanted cheese. By the way, there is also a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/7/24/17606958/meat-cheese-surplus-visualized"">2.5 billion pound</a> meat surplus — and in 2018, producers were running out of space to store it all. Both industries have been overproducing for years.</p>

<p>Cow-based dairy consumption in the US has <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/5-charts-that-show-how-milk-sales-have-changed.html"">been steadily declining</a> for decades, but even just a few years ago the government still granted the sector an unbelievable $22 billion in aid, which helped make up <a href=""https://www.realagriculture.com/2018/02/u-s-dairy-subsidies-equal-73-percent-of-producer-returns-says-new-report/"">73 percent</a> of dairy farmers’ marketplace “earnings.” This isn’t exclusive to the US — the EU subsidizes meat and dairy farms with an estimated £24 billion, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/nearly-a-fifth-of-eu-budget-goes-on-livestock-farming-greenpeace"">nearly a fifth</a> of the EU budget, in taxpayer money.</p>

<p>Just as World War II came to a close, the world found itself facing a new threat: the “Population Bomb”. In an eponymous book published in 1968, Stanford University Professor Paul R. Ehrlich noted that the rate of population growth would outpace agricultural production, leading to widespread famine and subsequent suffering in the 1970s and 1980s. Many now look back at that prediction and shame it as another example of fear-mongering about a Malthusian catastrophe that has been often repeated throughout history but never come to pass. The problem with these critiques in retrospect is that they assume it was rational to expect events to occur in the way they did to prevent the catastrophe. Essentially, claiming that concerns about a wide-spread famine were unfounded would only be logical if it was highly probable that the events that prevented that famine would occur as they did.</p>

<p>In fact, the events that prevented mass famine and starvation were anything but probable. A global famine that would have threatened the lives of more than one billion people was prevented in large part by the work of one man who never intended to take up that work in the first place. In spite of his monumental impact on the lives of billions of people, few enough know his name even today. That man was Norman Borlaug.</p>

<p>Norm, as Borlaug was known to all who worked with him, came from humble beginnings. He was born in a small town in the northeastern corner of Iowa, where he grew up on a farm and attended classes in a one-room schoolhouse. As he came of age in the midst of the Great Depression, Norm experienced firsthand the effects of the existing agricultural practices and how the resulting Dust Bowl devastated crop yields, soil quality, and the lives of farmers. These experiences impressed upon him that there had to be better ways to farm while preserving the land.</p>

<p>Norm went on to become the first in his family to attend college. He initially intended to train to become a high school science teacher but ended up studying forestry so he could enter the US Forestry Service as a Forest Ranger. The year of Norm’s graduation, however, budget cuts terminated the position for which he would have been hired. He was told that a spot may be available in six months. In the interim, Norm took a few extra credits in college and attended a lecture that would shape the rest of his life. Dr. Elvin Stakman, the head of the plant pathology department, gave the lecture on the topic of rust, a fungal disease that significantly reduces yields of wheat and a number of other cereal crops. At the end of that lecture, Dr. Stakman made a statement that would have strained credulity at the time, but which Borlaug’s work proved to be true. The science of rust resistance, Dr. Stakman said, would “go further than has ever been possible to eradicate the miseries of hunger and starvation from this earth.”</p>

<p>After that lecture, Borlaug’s life took a different path. He decided to pursue a doctorate in plant pathology at the University of Minnesota, and graduated in 1942 just after the United States had officially entered World War II. Norm went on to work for DuPont Corporation for two years as part of his wartime service. While at DuPont, Norm was approached by the Rockefeller Foundation to join a new project they were funding in rural Mexico. That project appointment, which Borlaug accepted, was to develop a rust-resistant wheat that would alleviate the food insecurity that plagued many Mexican communities.</p>

<p>“In 1944, when Borlaug arrived in Mexico, its farmers raised less than half of the wheat necessary to meet the demands of the population. Rust perennially ruined or diminished the harvest,” Professor R. Douglas Hurt, of the Department of History at Purdue University, observed. In Mexico, Norm worked with the local organization Centro Internacional de Majoramiento de Maize y Trigo (CIMMYT). Initially, it was tough for Borlaug. The local farmers had little reason to trust a young American who did not speak their language and were hesitant to adopt new farming techniques that they thought may leave them in an even more precarious situation.</p>

<p>But Norm, famous now for his work ethic, persevered, learning the local Spanish dialect and working long days in the fields breeding new strains wheat. “Borlaug labored for 13 years before he and his team of agricultural scientists developed a disease resistant wheat,” Professor Hurt states, “[But] still problems remained.” The primary problem was that the new rust-resistant wheat did not have stems strong enough to hold the now heavy heads of grain. As a result, the plants would blow over under heavy wind and rain, a process known as “lodging.”</p>

<p>To solve this new problem that stood between Borlaug and his goal of a self-sufficient Mexico, he looked to a dwarf strain of wheat from Japan. He sought to breed this dwarf strain with his rust-resistant strain, producing a wheat that could tolerate the hot, dry climate of northern Mexico without lodging during storms. But time was short. Without this new semi-dwarf wheat strain, Borlaug’s rust-resistant wheat was of limited use due to its vulnerability to storms.</p>

<p>To accelerate his breeding efforts, Borlaug developed a new method known as “shuttle breeding.” He grew two separate crops of wheat, one in the semi-arid, irrigated plains of Ciudad Obregón in Sonora and the other in the region of Toluca at an altitude or 2600m and under 1000mm of rainfall during the growing season. To take advantage of the two different growing seasons, he would harvest the crop from one region and shuttle the seeds to the other for planting. It also doubled Borlaug’s output per year compared to his peers.</p>

<p>This method effectively bred for a rust-resistant strain of wheat that could grow in most warm climates, since the same wheat was bred in two different climates. The result, a rust-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat, was broadly considered an agricultural miracle. Further, Norm’s unconventional shuttle breeding also led his wheat to be photoperiod insensitive, meaning that two crops per year could be cultivated, massively increasing the calories that could be produced per acre. Aided by irrigation and fertilizers, Borlaug’s wheat enabled Mexico to achieve grain self-sufficiency in 1956, something many others thought would be impossible for many more years.</p>

<p>But Norm did not consider this a victory. Rather, he considered it “a temporary success in man’s war against hunger and deprivation.” He recognized that the “Population Bomb” was still looming large in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and that further work was needed to ensure food security and stability in those regions. Norm was known to say that “world peace will not be built on empty stomachs.” Indeed, that statement would describe his life‘s work.</p>

<p>Norman Borlaug remains the only agricultural scientist to have ever been honored with the Nobel Peace Prize. He is also one of its least known recipients. His work is perhaps the single most important reason that food production expanded faster than human population everywhere in the world outside sub-Saharan Africa. His miracle wheat and rice ended cycles of famine in many countries and prevented mass starvations that would have numbered in the hundreds of millions in the following years. It is ironic that his name is largely unrecognized compared to his peer Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, given that he has “probably saved more lives than all of them put together.” Indeed, Borlaug is today frequently dubbed “the man who saved a billion lives.”</p>",6618,,
